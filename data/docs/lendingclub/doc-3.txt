Abstract: We study the determinants of borrowers’ default in P2P lending with a new data set
consisting of 70,673 loan observations from the Lending Club. Previous research identiﬁed a number
of default determining variables but did not distinguish between different loan risk levels. We deﬁne
four loan risk classes and test the signiﬁcance of the default determining variables within each loan
risk class. Our ﬁndings suggest that the signiﬁcance of most variables depends on the loan risk class.
Only a few variables are consistently signiﬁcant across all risk classes. The debt-to-income ratio,
inquiries in the past six months and a loan intended for a small business are positively correlated
with the default rate. Annual income and credit card as loan purpose are negatively correlated.

1. Introduction
Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms are new ﬁnancial intermediaries connecting borrowers and
lenders. Due to technological innovations they facilitate loans with low intermediation costs and thus
pose a threat for traditional banks [1]. Unsurprisingly, the popularity of P2P lending is rising rapidly.
For example, Lending Club, the biggest P2P lending platform in the world, almost doubled the amount
of issued loans from USD 4.4 billion in 2014 to USD 8.4 billion in 2015. The remarkable growth of P2P
lending is present in Europe [2] as well as in China [3].
The fundamental problem of lending is information asymmetry between borrowers and lenders:
borrowers have more information about their creditworthiness than lenders have. P2P lending
platforms try to decrease this information asymmetry. They apply credit scoring techniques and assign
a risk grade to each loan that may serve as a signal for lenders. Indeed, existing research [4–6] ﬁnds
a positive correlation between a loan’s default and the assigned risk grade. They also ﬁnd further
determinants of the default rate, for instance, the debt-to-income ratio or revolving credit utilization.
We conjecture that the signiﬁcance of these default determinants depends on the loan’s risk grade.
Thus, the goal of our study is to evaluate known determinants of borrowers’ default for each risk grade
separately. We test this with a new data set consisting of 70,673 loan observations from Lending Club.
Loans in our data set have a 36-month duration and were issued between January 2009 and December
2012, thus avoiding a structural break in the data due to the ﬁnancial crisis in 2007/2008.
We identify Annual Income, the Debt-to-Income ratio, Inquiries in Past 6 Months and the loan
purposes Credit Card and Small Business as signiﬁcant determinants of default in the full data set and
also across all loan risk classes. The signiﬁcance of other variables depends on the loan risk class.
For example, Revolving Credit Utilization which is signiﬁcant in our full data set and in less risky loan
classes is not signiﬁcant in loan classes with riskier loans.

We conclude that whether loan/borrower characteristics can be used to predict a loan’s default
chances actually depends on the loan’s risk class. We connect our ﬁndings to the literature on funding
success of P2P loans in an effort to understand to what extent insights about default determinants
are anticipated by lenders’ choices when funding a loan. Generally, our results contribute to a better
understanding of the mechanisms of P2P lending. Potential lenders, especially those investing in high
risk loans, can use our ﬁndings for their advantage and allocate their money more effectively.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Related literature is reviewed in Section 2.
We describe our data set and analytical approach in Section 3 and report our ﬁndings in Section 4.
Section 5 concludes.
2. Related Literature
P2P lending platforms are currently experiencing exponential growth1 with the USA being
the biggest P2P lending market. According to [2], there was an average yearly growth of 113%
in P2P consumer lending between 2012 and 2014 in Europe (excluding the UK). The amount of
funded P2P consumer loans increased from EUR 62.5 million in 2012 to EUR 274.6 million in 2014.
Furthermore, Ref. [3] add that P2P lending has been rapidly growing in China since its launch in 2007.
According to [10], there were 1575 P2P lending platforms in 2014 with an estimated volume of funded
loans between USD 20 and 40 billion by the end of 2015. These numbers would make China the second
largest P2P lending market in the world.
2.1. Funding Success of P2P Loans
A number of studies explore what factors contribute to the funding success of P2P loans. Most are
based on data from the platform Prosper which used to be the biggest P2P lending platform in the USA.
Prosper had many social features, such as a discussion forum and detailed borrowers’ characteristics
including their photos. Studies, among others, by [11,12], stress the importance of social relationships
for funding success. They ﬁnd that borrowers with better social ties are more likely to get their loans
funded and to receive a lower interest rate. However, social features were completely removed by
Prosper in 2008.2 Ref. [13] analyze data from the German platform Smava. Their results indicate that
men and women are equally likely to get funded.
Several studies focus on herding behavior in P2P lending. Ref. [14] conclude that a 1% increment
in the number of bids represents a 15% increase of the probability of an additional bid (until the loan is
fully funded). They also control for borrower/loan characteristics and ﬁnd that the debt-to-income
ratio is negatively correlated with funding, while the credit grade is positively correlated with funding.
They ﬁnd no relationship between funding and home ownership or the requested loan amount.
Ref. [15] ﬁnd that lenders observe their peers’ lending decisions and use this information to infer
creditworthiness of borrowers. Among their control variables, the debt-to-income ratio is negatively
correlated with funding, while the credit grade, home owner status and the amount requested are
positively correlated with funding.
2.2. Determinants of Borrowers’ Default
Investing at P2P lending platforms is a risky activity, because the offered loans are not secured.
To decrease the information asymmetry between lender and borrower, borrowers are obliged to provide
some personal information, such as annual income or the loan’s purpose. For example, borrowers at
Lending Club are required to provide detailed information about themselves and their credit history.
1
Two reasons for the rapid emergence of P2P lending platforms are put forward in the literature: low intermediation
costs [7,8] and credit rationing after the ﬁnancial crisis in 2007/2008 [9].
2
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ordered P2P lending companies to register their loans as securities and
provide them through a bank.

P2P lending platforms use this information to assess the likelihood of borrowers’ default and assign
him or her an appropriate interest rate with a given grade class.3 It is generally assumed that the better
the grade the more likely is the borrower to repay his or her debt.
There are several studies, such as [12,17], examining borrowers’ characteristics and their inﬂuence
on borrowers’ default based on data from Prosper. We do not review these studies in detail because
of the differences between the platforms Prosper and Lending Club.4 Instead, we focus on studies
examining borrowers’ default determinants based on Lending Club data: [4–6].
All three are in consensus that the Credit Grade5 assigned by Lending Club is the best predictor
for borrowers’ default. Moreover, Revolving Credit Line Utilization is another variable inﬂuencing the
default rate mentioned in all three papers. Findings of other default determinants vary. The discrepancy
between the ﬁndings of [4–6] might be caused by three different factors. The ﬁrst factor is the selection
of variables potentially having an impact on borrowers’ default. For example, Ref. [4,5] found out
that the FICO score has an inﬂuence on default. [6] did not choose the FICO score as an independent
variable in their study. The second factor potentially creating discrepancy between the ﬁndings is the
data set used. Speciﬁcally, differences in time frames, classiﬁcation of loan status or type of loan length
might be the cause. For example, Ref. [4,6] used only 36-month loans. Instead, Ref. [5], used both,
36- and 60-month loans. The last factor which might cause the discrepancy is the research method used.
Ref. [5] used dynamic logistic regression to assess determinants inﬂuencing default rate in P2P lending.
Ref. [6] conducted their study with a combination of univariate means test and Cox regression. Ref. [4]
chose binary logistic regression for their analysis. For better clarity, we summarize this information in

3. Data and Method
The aim of our study is to evaluate determinants of borrowers’ default within given loan grade
classes in P2P lending. The data we use come from Lending Club, the biggest P2P lending platform in
the world with total loan issuance of almost $16 billion by the end of 2015 [18]. First of all, we explain
the Lending Club process and the way how a prospective borrower can apply for a loan. Secondly,
we describe our data set. Thirdly, we explain the main variables of interest. At the end of this section,
we provide descriptive statistics of our variables and correlational matrixes.

An accurate credit scoring predictive model is crucial for P2P lending platforms. Ref. [16] conduct an extensive literature
review of more than 200 articles about credit scoring models. They conclude that there does not exist a single best statistical
technique used for the creation of credit scoring models.
4
Before the SEC regulation, as discussed above, Prosper used the Dutch auction to determine the appropriate interest rate
for borrowers. Moreover, Prosper used social features enabling social network effects between borrowers and lenders.
Even after the SEC regulation, there are still signiﬁcant differences between the platforms. These differences might make the
comparison of determinants inﬂuencing borrowers’ default inaccurate.

To better differentiate and highlight variables, we write them with capital letters and in italics.

3.1. The Lending Club Process
The Lending Club connects people who want to borrow money with people who are willing to
lend their money. Before applying for a loan at the Lending Club, a prospective borrower should ﬁnd
out the value of his/her FICO score which is widely used by banks and credit providers in the USA.6
The FICO score represents the creditworthiness of a person. It is computed based on a borrower’s
personal credit report provided by national credit bureaus in the USA. The exact formula for the
FICO score computation is held secret, only approximate weights of given categories are made public.7
About 90% of borrowers’ applications at Lending Club is rejected because of an insufﬁcient FICO
score. Only potential borrowers with a FICO score of at least 600 are allowed to apply for a loan at
Lending Club.
The potential borrower is further asked to provide some personal and loan information.
The self-reported information is his/her Annual Income, the current Home Situation (potential options
are own, mortgage or rent), the Length of Employment, the Loan Purpose and a Loan Description. All of
this information, except Loan Description, are mandatory.
After checking a borrower’s FICO score and his/her self-reported information, Lending Club
assigns a risk Loan Grade, from A to G, followed by a more accurate risk Loan Subgrade, from A1 to G5,
and a corresponding interest rate. The interest rate charged for A1 was 5.32% and 28.99% for G5 in the
ﬁrst quarter of 2016. Lending Club’s credit scoring model is kept secret. The P2P lending platform,
however, afﬁrms that the risk Loan Grade and Subgrade are computed based on the borrower’s FICO
score and his or her personal and loan information.
If the offered loan conditions and the interest rate are accepted by the borrower, Lending Club
announces the loan on its website. Potential lenders can then view the loan online and start to fund it.
During the loan’s funding period, Lending Club might ask the borrower to verify the self-reported
information. The loan might be removed from Lending Club’s website, if the borrower’s self-reported
information cannot be veriﬁed. However, if the loan gets funded before the veriﬁcation is done,
the veriﬁcation is not needed anymore and the loan is issued.
3.2. Our Data Set
In an effort to be fully transparent about company and loan performance, the Lending Club
makes public the data of every loan they have ever issued. The information about these loans used to
be updated daily, then monthly and currently is updated quarterly. Our Lending Club data set was
downloaded in February 2016. It contains information about 884,633 loans issued between June 2007
and December 2015.
From this data we chose only loans issued between January 2009 and December 2012 with
36-months duration. We focus on this period because of the following reasons. First, the default rate
(16.10%) of loans issued before January 2009 is higher than the default rate (12.49%) of loans issued
between January 2009 and December 2012 (two-sided t-test, p < 0.001). This difference might be
caused by the ﬁnancial crisis in 2007/2008 which hit hard many US households. We decided to use
only observations after 2008 in order to avoid a structural break in our data set. Moreover, we have not
included loans issued after December 2012 as their maturity has not yet been reached. For a similar
reason we have neither included loans with 60-month duration. Loans with 60-month duration were
ﬁrstly introduced in 2010. Therefore, their maturity has not yet been reached in the data set we have.
For our analysis, we classify loans in our data set as ‘Fully Paid’ or as ‘Charged Off’.
This classiﬁcation will help us to differentiate between good (Fully Paid) and bad (Charged Off)
loans. The loans in our data set, however, have six different statuses: Fully Paid, Charged Off, Current,
6
According to myf [19], up to 90% of top lenders use the FICO score.
7
The FICO score consists of ﬁve categories from a person’s ﬁnancial history: the payment history (about 35% weight),
debt burden (30% weight), length of credit history (15%), types of credit used and recent searches for credit (both 10%).

Default, Late (31–120 days), Late (16–30 days) and In Grace Period. See Part A in Table 2 for the
distribution of loan statuses in our data set. A loan is marked as Fully Paid when the full principal
with interest rates is paid back. A loan with status Charged Off is a loan where a borrower defaulted
on the loan and the loan will never be paid back in full amount. Even though we have chosen our
dataset’s time span so that all loans are supposed to have already reached their maturity, there are still
some loans which have not been completely paid back or charged off. This is usually caused by some
delayed instalments in the credit life span. Delayed instalments extend the whole maturity of a loan.
These loans have statuses Current, In Grace Period, Late (16–30 days), Late (31–120 days) or Defaulted.
There are 33 loans with status Current. These loans are currently being paid back. We do not include
them in our analyses, because we do not know whether they will or will not be paid back. In a
similar vein, there are six loans with status In Grace Period and 6 loans with status Late (16–30 days).
In Grace Period means that a loan instalment is delayed by at most 15 days. A loan with status Late
(16–30 days) has a delayed instalment between 16–30 days. We do not consider loans with statuses
In Grace Period and Late (16–30 days) as Charged off, because these loans are not delayed by more
than 30 days. According to the Lending Club statistics, 75% of loans with status Late (31–120 days)
are charged off [18]. We believe that this percentage is even higher for loans with instalment delayed
by 90 or more days. There are 81 loans with status Late (31–120 days) and 46 of them are delayed by
more than 90 days. We consider all of them as Charged Off. Loans with status Default have delayed
instalment by more than 120 days. We consider them as Charged Off. The proportion of Fully Paid and
Charged Off loans are shown in Part B of Table 2. The number of Charged Off loans in Part B includes
all Charged Off loans from Part A, 46 loans with status Late (31–120 days) and 12 Default loans.

Note: The number in parentheses of loans with status Late (31–120 days) or Default denote how many of
these loans are considered as Charged Off in Part B.
We distinguish between the following loan risk classes in our analysis. A-graded loans belong
to the Low-Risk Class, the Medium-Risk Class consists of B-graded loans and C-graded loans are in the
High-Risk Class. Loans graded with D, E, F and G are aggregated to the Very High-Risk Class in order
to make the classes somewhat comparable in terms of the number of observations. Table 3, part A,
provides an overview of the four loan classes and their corresponding loan grades, average default
rates and average FICO scores. Loans in the Very High-Risk Class, see part B in Table 3, are quite similar
in terms of FICO score and default rate. Only the default rate of G-graded loans stands out. However,
as there are only 76 G-graded loans, it would not be useful to create a separate group for these loans.
Therefore, we added G-graded loans to the same class as D-, E- and F-graded loans.

3.3. Variables of Interest
There are 78 variables in the data set provided by Lending Club.8 Not all are of interest for us as
some do not include any values (such as Personal Finance Inquiries and Finance Trades) or do not contain
useful information for our purposes (like Loan URL and Loan ID).
Our variables of interest can be divided into two sources of information origin. The ﬁrst source
is the borrower’s self-reported information. Borrower’s self-reported information are Annual Income,
Housing Situation, Length of Employment, Loan Amount, Loan Purpose, and Loan Description. The second
source of information origin is the borrower’s credit ﬁle provided by one of three national credit
bureaus in the USA. We choose the following variables from a borrower’s credit ﬁle: Debt−to−Income,
Delinquency in Past 2 Years, Date of First Credit Line, Inquiries in Past 6 Months, Months since Last
Delinquency, Months since Last Record, Open Credit Lines, and Revolving Credit Utilization. The description
of our variables is included in Table A1 in Appendix A.
We modiﬁed two variables from the original data set. The ﬁrst variable is Loan Description. It is
provided by a borrower when applying for a loan. There are many ways to use Loan Description as an
independent variable that might be the predictor for borrowers’ default. For example, Ref. [5] extracted
two dummy variables from Loan Description: Borrower’s Self-Claimed Creditworthiness and Description
Lacking Full Stop. He found that both variables are signiﬁcant for default prediction. Our approach is
different from [5]. We count the number of characters in Loan Description and call this new variable
Number of Characters. The second variable of interest from the original data set that was modiﬁed is
Date of First Credit Line. It is a variable in the form of ‘month-year’ and represents the reported date of
the ﬁrst open credit line. We transformed this variable into the number of years since the ﬁrst reported
credit line was opened. The name of this new variable is Length of Credit History.
Thus, our variables are fairly similar to variables used by [4–6]. Unlike these papers though,
we do not include information about the Loan Subgrade and the FICO Score. Furthermore, we neither
include the Loan Grade nor the Interest Rate. All these variables are highly correlated, because Loan
Subgrade, which is more speciﬁc than Loan Grade, is largely based on the FICO score. The interest rate is
then assigned based on the Loan Subgrade.

We have downloaded the data from the download data section at the Lending Club website. Moreover, the download data
section’s Data Dictionary provides variable descriptions [18].

3.4. Descriptive Statistics
Table A2 in Appendix B contains the correlation matrix table of all non-categorical variables.
The correlation matrix is based on our full data set of 70,673 observations. The highest correlation
(0.33) is between Debt-to-Income and Open Credit Lines. The second largest correlation, which is 0.29,
is between Annual Income and Loan Amount. All correlations between Default and other variables are
less than 0.1. The most correlated variable with Default is Revolving Credit Utilization with a correlation
of 0.08.
Table A3 in Appendix B contains descriptive statistics of our full data set. There are 82 missing
values of Revolving Credit Utilization and 2538 missing values of Length of Employment. We have
excluded all 82 observations with missing values of Revolving Credit Utilization from our data set.
Excluding 2538 observations with missing values of Length of Employment from our dataset would
mean a signiﬁcant loss of information for our hypotheses testing. However, we have found that the
Length of Employment is not a signiﬁcant determinant of borrowers’ default. This ﬁnding allows us to
exclude the Length of Employment from our further analysis.
Overall, there are 15 observations in our data set with a self-reported income exceeding USD
1,000,000 and we have decided to exclude these outliers. Thus our ﬁnal data set for the remaining
analyses includes 70,579 observations.
Table A4 in Appendix B presents mean values of the non-categorical variables, in particular loan
classes. Interestingly, the highest mean of Annual Income is in the Very High-Risk Class. Furthermore,
borrowers from the Very High-Risk Class wrote, on average, the longest loan descriptions. They might
be afraid that their loan will not be funded because of their inferior credit grade. Therefore, they might
try to provide a sound explanation of the loan need to their potential funders. Concerning Loan Amount,
Delinquency in past 2 Years, Inquiries in Past 6 Months, Months since Last Delinquency and Months since
Last Record, Open Credit Lines and Revolving Credit Utilization variables, we can observe a rising trend of
variable mean values from Low-Risk Class to Very High-Risk Class. The only variable with a declining
trend of its mean value is the Length of Credit History.
Finally, we look at the default statistics of our categorical variables. Table A5 in Appendix B
contains the Loan Purpose default statistics. The trend of the default rate is clearly rising with the
riskiness of a given loan class—starting with a default rate of 6.59% in the Low-Risk Class and ending
with 20.06% in the Very High-Risk Class. The two most frequent loan purposes are Debt Consolidation
(51.94% of all loans) and Credit Card (18.28%). Furthermore, the purposes Car and Major Purchase have
the smallest default rates across all classes. On the other hand, loans with purpose Small Business or
Renewable Energy have the highest default rate in the All Classes category.9 It is interesting to observe
how default rates of given Loan Purposes change in particular loan classes. For example, loans with the
purpose Moving have a higher default rate in the Medium-Risk Class (17.97%) than in the High-Risk Class
(14.74%). Similar examples are loans with Home Improvement, Vacation or Car purpose. Table A6 in
Appendix B contains the Home Situation default statistics. As expected and similarly to the Loan Purpose
the default rate is rising with the riskiness of a given loan class. The most frequent Home Situations are
Rent (48.80% of all loans) and Mortgage (42.86%). The frequency of the Home Situation Other (0.16% of
all loans) and No Information (0.05%) are negligible.
4. Results
We generally use binary logistic regression speciﬁcations to analyze the determinants of borrowers’
default.10 We use backward stepwise elimination to ﬁnd the most suitable model speciﬁcation, that is,
9
We do not further comment loans with Renewable Energy purpose, because they make up only a small percentage (0.20%) of
all loans. The same applies to the loans with purpose Education (0.34%).
10
All statistical analyses are performed using the software R (version 3.2.3) with its integrated development environment
called RStudio. We use the glm function of the family binomial.

we start with a full model including all 13 variables of interest. We then drop every variable with
ap-value higher than 0.1 starting with the variable with the highest p-value. Backward stepwise
elimination is sometimes criticized for producing models which do not ﬁt the data well. Critics of
this approach argue that other models might dominate the model achieved by backward stepwise
elimination in terms of the Akaike information criterion (AIC), a measurement of relative model
quality for a given data set. As a robustness check, we have run additional regressions which
employ an automated selection of the best model with AIC as criterion. All of our speciﬁcations
reached by backward stepwise elimination are the same as the speciﬁcations chosen by using AIC as
selection criterion.
We ﬁrst run a logistic regression on the full data set (All Classes) because of two reasons. We want
to compare our All Classes ﬁndings with results of [4–6]. Moreover, this allows us to highlight the
differences between our regression results from given loan classes and the regression ﬁndings based
on the whole data set.
Results from the All Classes regression are in Table 4.
The coefﬁcients of Loan Amount,
Debt-to-Income, Delinquency in Past 2 Years, Inquiries in Past 6 Months, Revolving Credit Utilization,
Months since Last Record are all positive and highly signiﬁcant. The coefﬁcients of Annual Income,
Number of Characters and Lenght of Credit History are all negative and highly signiﬁcant. The variable
Open Credit Lines is not signiﬁcant.
The loan purposes Car, Credit Card, Debt Consolidation,
Home Improvement, Major Purchase, and Wedding are negatively correlated with loan default,
while Renewable Energy, and Small Business are positively correlated with loan default. Home ownership
(status Mortgage) is negatively correlated with loan default.
We proceed with regressions for the four loan risk classes, see also Table 4. Results for the Low
Risk and Medium Risk classes only differ slightly from the All Classes results. In both the Lenght of Credit
History and the loan purpose Home Improvement are not signiﬁcant anymore. Months since Last Record is
not signiﬁcant in the Low Risk class, while it is signiﬁcant in the Medium Risk class. Delinquency in Past
2 Years is not signiﬁcant in the Medium Risk class, while it is highly signiﬁcant in the Low Risk class.
In the High Risk and Very High Risk classes, the Number of Characters are not signiﬁcant anymore as
well as the loan purposes Car, Debt Consolidation, Home Improvement and Renewable Energy. The Lenght
of Credit History is not signiﬁcant in the High Risk class but it is signiﬁcant in the Very High Risk class.
The loan purpose Major Purchase is not signiﬁcant anymore in the Very High Risk class.
Revolving Credit Utilization has been found to be a signiﬁcant predictor for borrowers’ default in
all related studies [4–6] as well as in our All Classes data. However, it is only signiﬁcant in our Low-Risk
and Medium-Risk Classes. It is not a signiﬁcant determinant in the High-Risk and Very High-Risk Class.
Result 1. Revolving Credit Utilization is a positive determinant of borrowers’ default only in low loan
risk classes.
The Debt-to-Income ratio is signiﬁcant in all loan classes. In fact, the Debt-to-Income ratios for
defaulted/non-defaulted loans have almost identical values across risk classes.
Result 2. The Debt-to-Income ratio is a positive determinant of borrowers’ default in all loan risk classes.
The current Housing Situation is a signiﬁcant determinant of default in All Classes, as well as in the
Low-Risk, Medium-Risk and High Risk classes. It is, however, not signiﬁcant in the Very High-Risk Class.
Defaulting on a loan when having a mortgage on a house would mean the loss of the house. Therefore,
there might be a higher motivation for borrowers to avoid default when having the mortgage than
living in a rented home. One of the possibilities to avoid default is to take a further loan. Borrowers from
the Very High-Risk Class may not have such an opportunity which might explain that there is no effect
of the Current Housing Situation.

Result 3. Home ownership is not a signiﬁcant determinant of borrowers’ default in the highest loan risk class.
Overall, creditworthy borrowers write, on average, 169 characters in their loan descriptions
compared to 157 characters in loan descriptions of defaulted loans. This difference is highly signiﬁcant
(p < 0.001). Moreover, it is interesting to observe that borrowers in the Very High-Risk Class write,
on average, the most characters in their Loan Description compared to borrowers from other classes.
Borrowers from the Very High-Risk Class might feel that their Loan Description must be comprehensive
in order to get funding with a risky loan grade. However, the Number of Characters are neither
signiﬁcant in the Very High-Risk Class nor in the High-Risk Class, while they are in low risk classes.
Result 4. In low loan risk classes, creditworthy borrowers write, on average, a longer Loan Description than
borrowers who defaulted.
It seems that a loan used for Credit Card consolidation has a signiﬁcantly higher chance to be paid
back even in the Very High-Risk Class, while loans used for a Small Business generally bear a higher
risk of default independently of the associated risk class. For example, the default rates of loans with
purpose Small Business are twice as high as default rates of loans with Car or Wedding as the purpose.
Results 5. The loan purposes Credit Card and Small Business are signiﬁcant determinants of borrowers’ default
in all loan risk classes.
The Length of Credit History is negatively correlated with loan default in our All Classes regression
results.
This ﬁnding is in line with [5,6]’s results.
However, it is only supported in the Very
High-Risk Class. The Length of Credit History is not a signiﬁcant determinant of default in the Low-Risk,
Medium-Risk and High-Risk classes. It seems that experience with loans in the Very High-Risk Class is of
advantage as people get used to live close to their credit limits. For example, a young man without any
previous credit experiences classiﬁed to be in the Very High-Risk Class, also without any ﬁnancial buffer,
can easily overdraw his credit. This might cause a default because of insufﬁcient credit experience and
a lack of possibilities of obtaining an additional loan.
Result 6. The Length of Credit History is a negative determinant of borrowers’ default only in the High-Risk Class.
Discussion
In our full data set, all variables of interest turn out to be signiﬁcant determinants of default
except the variable Open Credit Lines. Table 5 provides a comparison of our All Classes ﬁndings and
the previously mentioned studies. Generally, discrepancies of results could be due to the fact that
our data avoids the structural break of loan defaults possibly caused by the 2007/08 ﬁnancial crisis.11
See Table 1 for differences of the data and methodology. The only difference to [5]’s results is that
Debt-to-Income is not a signiﬁcant predictor of borrowers’ default in his study. This difference might be
caused by the fact that [5] used loans with status ‘current’ in his analyses. Comparing our results to [6],
two discrepancies are worth to note. Loan Amount is not signiﬁcant in their study but in ours and Open
Credit Lines is signiﬁcant in theirs but not in ours. Finally, our All Classes results are quite different
from [4]’s results. Besides differences in the time frame of the data set, Ref. [4] include the Loan Credit
Grade and FICO score as explanatory variables in their regression. A high correlation between FICO
score and other variables of interest is to be expected, because the FICO score is computed based on
these values. The same may apply to the Loan Grade.

We show that loans issued before 2009 have signiﬁcantly higher default rates than loans issued between 2009 and 2012.

Note: The mark x denotes that a given variable was found to be a signiﬁcant determinant of borrowers’ default.
Overall, we ﬁnd the following determinants of borrowers’ default which are signiﬁcant in All
Classes as well as in the loan classes separately: Annual Income, Debt-to-Income, Inquiries in Past 6 Months
and the loan purposes Credit Card and Small Business. The signiﬁcance of other variables varies class
by class. Revolving Credit Utilization, Number of Characters or the Lenght of Credit History are signiﬁcant
for All Classes but not in given loan classes. Only Open Credit Lines is neither signiﬁcant in any class
nor on the full data set.
In terms of economic signiﬁcance, the following changes of the predicted default probability
result from a one standard deviation change of our main explanatory variables: Annual Income (0.005),
Debt-to-Income (0.01), Inquiries in Past 6 Months (0.02) and the loan purposes Credit Card (−0.06) and
Small Business (0.08). Given that, on average, 12.5% of all loans default, a one standard deviation
change of the Debt-to-Income ratio increases the chances of default by 6%.12 This value increases to 12%
for high risk loans.
As a robustness check of our loan grade classiﬁcation we merge the two smallest classes, the High
and Very High-Risk Class, and consider them jointly. All regressors that are signiﬁcant in the High-Risk
Class are at least as signiﬁcant in the regression speciﬁcation with observations from both risk classes.
In addition, the variables Loan Amount and Months since Last Record are positively correlated with
default. The loan purposes Car and Wedding are negatively correlated with default.
Finally, we address to what extent these insights are taken into account by lenders, when they
decide whether to fund a loan or not. For this purpose, we draw on evidence from existing studies
who analyze the funding success of P2P loans. According to both [14,15] loans have a higher chance
to attract funding, the lower the debt-to-income ratio is and the better the credit grade is. Moreover,
Ref. [15] ﬁnd a positive correlation between funding success and the amount requested as well as
whether the borrower’s home is owned. Our analysis reassures lenders’ skepticism about a borrower’s
debt-to-income ratio. Other characteristics warrant more caution. We ﬁnd that the home ownership
status is only a good indicator of a loan getting paid back if the loan is not from the highest risk class.
Our results provide insights for potential P2P lenders, especially those who seek to strictly
maximize their proﬁt. As mentioned in Section 3, investing in the Very High-Risk Class at Lending Club
historically yields the highest net proﬁt (after accounting for defaulted loans). Thus, investors whose
primary goal is to achieve a high return on their investment will target the high risk segment and
will try to optimize their loan portfolio choices. Our results contribute to a better understanding to
what extent our existing knowledge about loan default determinants applies in this high risk segment.
It seems that for high risk loans Revolving Credit Utilization or the Home Situation status are treacherous
predictors of default. Instead, the mindful investor should target the Length of Credit History, Inquiries in

The standard deviation of the Debt-to-Income ratio is 0.074, see Table A3. Multiplying with the marginal effect (0.1025) results
in a predicted change of 0.007585. This is 6% of the average default probability of 0.125.

Past 2 Years, Annual Income, the Debt-to-Income ratio and the loan purposes Credit Card or Small Business
as reliable predictors of default.
5. Conclusions
P2P lending connects people in need for a loan with people willing to lend their money.
The intermediation of credit is handled through more or less automated online platforms with very
low transaction costs. The beneﬁts of automation can transform into lower interest rates for borrowers
and higher interest earnings for lenders in comparison to traditional banks.
However, information asymmetries between borrowers and lenders remain a central issue faced
by P2P lending platforms. Credit scoring techniques are employed to address this. They assign a credit
grade to each loan based on the perceived risk of default. Riskier loans are associated with higher
interest rates as higher interest rates serve as compensation for a potential loan default. Besides the
credit grade and interest rate, P2P lending platforms usually provide a prospective lender with a large
amount of information about a loan’s and borrower’s characteristics.
Previous research [4–6] identifed some of the borrower’s and loan’s information as useful
determinants for borrowers’ default. We conjecture that the signiﬁcance of default determining
variables might not be the same in different loan risk classes. In other words, some variables are only
signiﬁcant default determinants in speciﬁc loan classes.
While results on our full data set are largely in line with ﬁndings of previous studies, our set of
separate regressions for each loan risk class identiﬁes only Annual Income, Debt-to-Income, Inquiries in
Past 2 Years and the loan purposes Credit Card and Small Business as signiﬁcant determinants of loan
default in all loan risk classes. Revolving Credit Utilization, Delinquency in Past 2 Years and Number of
Characters are only signiﬁcant for low loan risk classes. Lenght of Credit History is only signiﬁcant for
high loan risk classes.
Our analysis conﬁrms that loan/borrower characteristics can indeed be used to predict a loan’s
default chances. However, since default determinants depend on the loan’s risk class, caution is
warranted. What seems to be a good predictor of loan default based on overall data may not be reliable
in the highest loan risk class. This is relevant since the high risk segment is most attractive to some
lenders due to the highest returns that can be reached.
