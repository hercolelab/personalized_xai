Abstract
Purpose – The research documented in this paper aims to examine multiple factors related to borrowers’
default in peer-to-peer (P2P) lending in the USA. This study is motivated by the hypothesis that both P2P loan
characteristics and macroeconomic variables have influence on loan performance. The authors define a set of
loan characteristics, borrower characteristics and macroeconomic variables that are significant in determining
the probability of default and should be taken into consideration when assessing credit risk.
Design/methodology/approach – The research question in this study is to find the significant explanatory
variables that are essential in determining the probability of default for LendingClub loans. The empirical
study is based on a total number of 1,863,491 loan records issued through LendingClub from 2007 to 2020Q3
and a logistic regression model is developed to predict loan defaults.
Findings – The results, in line with prior research, show that a number of borrower and contractual loan
characteristics predict loan defaults. The innovation of this study is the introduction of specific macroeconomic
indicators. The study indicates that macroeconomic variables assessed alongside loan data can significantly
improve the forecasting performance of default model. The general finding demonstrates that higher
percentage change in House Price Index, Consumer Sentiment Index and S&P500 Index is associated with a
lower probability of delinquency. The empirical results also exhibit significant positive effect of unemployment
rate and GDP growth rate on P2P loan default rates.
Practical implications – Theresultshaveimportantimplications forinvestors forwhomit isof greatimportance
to know the determinants of borrowers’ creditworthiness and loan performance when estimating the investment in a
certain P2P loan. Inaddition, the forecasting performance of the modelcould be appliedby authorities in order to deal
with the credit risk in P2P lending and to prevent the effects of increasing defaults on the economy.
Originality/value – This paper fulfills an identified need to shed light on the association between specific
macroeconomic indicators and the default risk from P2P lending within an economy, while the majority of the
existing literature investigate loan and borrower information to evaluate credit risk of P2P loans and predict
the likelihood of default.

1. Introduction
Peer-to-peer (P2P) or marketplace lending emerged soon after the global financial crisis and now
is the leading alternative finance format globally. P2P credit allows direct matching of lenders’
supply and borrowers’ demand of funding, without the intermediation of traditional banking. In
online marketplaces borrowers raise funding from multiple lenders (individuals or institutions).
Despite the benefits of this new on-line lending channel, it remains a risky activity for lenders
since the default risk in this lending market is still high. The aim of this study is to find what
determines marketplace loan performance, investigating multiple factors.

Credit risk stems from the possibility of the borrower defaulting payments, because of the
inability or lack of willingness to pay them back. For investors it is essential to know the
determinants of loan performance in order to focus on the most relevant influential factors
when estimating whether a particular loan is worth an investment or not. Studying the
default behavior is of great importance as the higher default rates in this market, compared to
the corresponding rates in the banking system, may lead to financial stability disruptions and
can evolve into a financial crisis, if the credit risk in the P2P market spread and contaminate
the financial market.
Many studies that examine marketplace default risk use data of the earliest years of the
operation of this market (see, e.g. Carmichael, 2014; M€ollenkamp, 2017; Serrano-Cinca et al.,
2015). We examine 1,863,491 P2P loans with clear payment status outcome that were
originated during the period 2007-2020Q3 via LendingClub, the largest online lender in the
USA and worldwide.
Our analysis confirms that loan and borrower characteristics can indeed be used to predict
probability of default. More specifically, our results show that characteristics explaining
defaults are, among others, loan amount, loan maturity, number of delinquency incidences
and recent credit inquiries. The most important factor of loan performance is the credit grade
that is assigned by LendingClub. Higher credit grade loan is associated with lower
default risk.
Our study aims to extend the P2P literature by investigating specific macroeconomic
factors as determinants of default risk. We specifically examine the impact of GDP growth
rate, Unemployment rate, House Price Index (HPI), Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI) and
S&P500 Index on borrowers’ probability of default.
Our results confirm the theoretical predictions, i.e. macroeconomic factors play a crucial
role in consumer default. The empirical evidence shows a positive relationship between
Unemployment rate and an increase in delinquencies and between GDP growth rate and
delinquencies. On the other hand, we find that the HPI, CSI and S&P500 Index are negatively
correlated with the defaults. Our results are supported by the literature on banks and
traditional financial services (see, e.g. Skarica, 2014; Mateus, 2020; Crook and Banasik, 2012;
Fallanca et al., 2020; Ghosh, 2017). The findings of our empirical study reveal that the
inclusion of these indicators improves model fit and prediction of default.
This paper contributes to the growing literature on P2P lending in two important ways.
Firstly, this study shed light on the association between specific macroeconomic indicators
and the default risk from P2P lending within an economy, while the majority of the existing
literature investigates loan and borrower information to evaluate credit risk of P2P loans and
predict the likelihood of default. Secondly, our conclusions are more robust and updated
since, unlike previous studies, a more comprehensive dataset of default determinants is used
spanning 14 years (from 2007 to 2020).
The rest of this paper is organized in the following order: Section 2 presents the literature
review. Section 3 shows the statistical analysis for P2P loans. Section 4 provides empirical
results for the determinants of loan default. The final section is outlying the conclusion and
policy implications.
2. Literature review
The majority of FinTech lending literature has mainly focused on the explanation of the
emergence and expansion of P2P credit and on the P2P loan performance and default risk.
Balyuk and Davydenko (2018) document that marketplace lending have evolved from
trading venues into credit intermediaries and the most P2P loans being funded by
institutional investors, such as banks. Rau (2020) investigates the determinants of the
crowdfunding development and finds that the quality of regulation, the financial system
JES

inefficiency and the ease of Internet access all provide very robust links to crowdfunding
volumes. Havrylchyk et al. (2019) examine the drivers of the expansion of P2P lending in the
USA and find evidence that counties that were more affected by financial crisis, with weak
banking competition and higher population density have more P2P loans per capita. Oh and
Rosenkranz (2020) find that financial institutions’ efficiency, financial literacy and lower
branch and ATM penetration are positively related with the expansion of P2P lending.
Many researchers examine the risk related to the marketplace lending (see, e.g. K€afer,
2016; Durovic, 2017; Lenz, 2017; Setyaningsih et al., 2019). Suryono et al. (2019) mention six
core problems associated to P2P lending, namely information asymmetry, determination of
borrower credit scores, moral hazard, investment decisions, platform feasibility and
immature regulations. Zhao et al. (2021) discuss the credit risk contagion of P2P lending and
find that the platform correlations, the susceptible immune rate, the elimination rate of the
P2P platforms by regulatory agencies, the saturation coefficient and other factors affect the
risk contagion in the Internet financial market.
Di Maggio and Yao (2021), using a consumer credit panel dataset, document that FinTech
borrowers are more likely to default and exhibit higher indebtedness than borrowers from
traditional financial institutions. Lots of studies in the FinTech literature focus on the
determinants of P2P loan default by examining the performance of these loans. Most of these
studies explore loan and borrower characteristics to evaluate credit risk of P2P loans and
predict the likelihood of default (see, e.g. Carmichael, 2014; M€ollenkamp, 2017). Serrano-Cinca
et al. (2015), using a sample of 24,449 loans, issued through LendingClub from 2008 until 2014
find that factors that best explain default are loan purpose, annual income, current housing
situation and indebtedness. They conclude that credit grade has the highest predictive
probability, but their model can be improved by including other factors. Similarly, Jagtiani
and Lemieux (2019) find that the assigned rating grades perform well in predicting loan
performance over the two years after origination. Emekter et al. (2015) indicates that credit
score, debt-to-income (DTI) ratio and FICO score play an important role in loan defaults.
Durovic (2017) analyzes two loan characteristics, loan term length and loan purpose and finds
that longer term loans are more risky than the shorter term ones and the least risky loans are
those used for credit card payoff.
Polena and Regner (2018) define four loan risk classes (based on the assigned credit grade)
and find that the borrower’s and loan’s information that identified as determinants for default
in previous studies are only significant in specific loan classes. Chen et al. (2022) use
transaction data from LendingClub originated from 2015 until 2018 to estimate the gross rate
of return (ROR) on an individual loan base and their results reveal that borrowers’ credit
rating, loan interest rate, loan status and paid-month are the most critical factors to influence
investors’ ROR.
Lots of studies in banking literature show that economic conditions play a crucial role in
consumer delinquency and thus should be taken into consideration when assessing loan
performance. Louzis et al. (2012) investigating the determinants of non-performing loans in
Greek banking system show that GDP, unemployment, interest rate and public debt have a
strong effect on the level of NPLs in all loan categories. Similar study on the Italian banking
system was conducted by Foglia (2022). Their empirical findings show that GDP and public
debt have a negative impact on NPLs and unemployment rate and domestic credit a positive
one. Wadud et al. (2020) provide evidence on the determinants of household loan delinquency
for mortgages, credit card and auto loans in the USA. They report positive effect of
unemployment rate on delinquency rates and adverse effect of current consumer sentiment
and per capita income. Research of Mateus (2020) demonstrates that consumer sentiment and
the S&P 500 index impact negatively on delinquency and default. Bofondi and Ropele (2011)
examine the macroeconomic determinants of banks’ loan quality in Italy and find that the
Factors

lending

growth rates of GDP, the stock prices index and house price index are negatively correlated
with probability of defaulting on loans.
Recent studies are beginning to expand the research on loan default in P2P lending
industry by investigating factors, other than loan and borrower characteristics. Nigmonov
et al. (2022), utilizing a probit regression analysis, investigate the macroeconomic factors that
influence default risk and show that a higher interest rate and inflation increase the
probability of default in P2P lending. Croux et al. (2020) by including in their model, aside
from the data provided by LendingClub, variables such as GDP growth, VIX Index and
Russell 2000 Index, show that macroeconomic conditions also impact the likelihood of P2P
loan default.
3. Preliminary analysis of P2P loans
3.1 Data selection
This study uses data from the LendingClub platform. Our data set contains information
about 2,925,440 loans issued between June 2007 and September 2020 [1]. Over the loan
origination study period LendingClub lent around $45bn to borrowers. The loans in our data
set have seven different statuses: Fully Paid, Charged Off, Current, Default, Late (31–
120 days), Late (16–30 days) and In Grace Period. Figure 1 shows the number of loans in
each loan status per year.
Only the loans with exact ending resolution of the payment are useful, in order to
distinguish between “good” and “bad” loans and estimate the probability of a loan default.
Thus, we have removed the categories Current, Default, Late (31–120 days), Late (16–30 days)
and In Grace Period, since they include loans that do not yet have a clear payment status
outcome. Our final sample consist of funded loans whose outcome is known, i.e. “Charged Off”
or “Fully Paid”.
3.2 Statistical analysis
Table 1 reports the loan temporal distribution of the selected sample and presents statistics
on the total number and amount of funded loans with known outcome across time, the status
outcomes of these (fully paid or charged off) and the corresponding loan default rate per year
(default rate is given by dividing the defaulted loans by total number of matured loans).
From the selected 1,863,491 loans, 363,826 defaulted and 1,499,759 repaid fully. The fully
paid status has the largest share (80.5% of issued loans on average), while the percentage of
default status increasingly grows every year, from 15.6% in 2007–2013 to 24% in 2018.

lending

Overall, the ratio default per total loans is 19.5% with total amount of defaulted loans $ 5.8bn.
The highest rate of default was recorded in 2018 (24%) with total losses of $ 812m.
Figure 2 presents a comparison of the default rate of P2P loans and delinquency rates on
consumer loans, credit card loans and business loans over the time under consideration.
Default rates in P2P lending are reflected over time at higher levels compared to traditional
loans (average default rate 17.3 vs 2.78%) and peak in 2018, while the corresponding rate of
traditional lending peaks in 2009.
Table 2 presents the self-reported loan purpose default statistics. It indicates that the loans
that are supposed to be used for debt consolidation and credit card debts are the most
frequent. The highest default rate is observed in loans for small business funding (28.7%),
followed by loans regarding house buying (22.2%) and loans for moving purposes (22.1%).
The less risky loan purpose for lenders is wedding loans and car purchase (repayment rate
87.6 and 85.8% respectively).

LendingClub evaluate borrowers’ riskiness to default and classifies them in credit grades
from A (low risk borrowers) to G (high risk borrowers). The grades are used to assign the
interest rate of the funded loan (borrowers in grade G exhibit higher likelihood of delinquency
and thus they are charged higher interest rate). Table 3 shows loans temporal distribution
among the seven credit grades. The majority (29.4% of total loans) of issued loans belong to
grade B, closely followed by credit grade C (28.4%). Credit grade G, as expected, presents the
highest default rate (48.8%). The second worst loan performance is observed in F-graded
loans (44.3% default rate). Finally, all loan categories reached their peak during the issued
year 2018. Only 6.5% of total loans stem from credit grade A defaulted.
4. The empirical study
4.1 Variables and model
The research question in this study is to find the significant explanatory variables that are
essential in determining the probability of default for LendingClub loans. We employ binary
logistic regression to assess the capability of determinants analyzed to predict the loan
default.
(1)
Dependent variable
Since two outcomes are possible, the dependent variable is binary (or dichotomous) and
presents the status of loan payment “Charged Off”.
(2)
Independent variables
The factors that usually predict the repayment of a loan or its default are expected to be loan
and individual borrower characteristics. There are more than 100 variables in the data set of
LendingClub, but not all are of interest for our analysis. Our variables were selected based on
the results of previous studies on P2P default behavior and have been proved to play essential
role in borrower solvency. Table A1 summarizes the P2P variables explanation. Except for
term, grade, employment length, home ownership and loan purpose, all the other variables are
continuous.
We expect that loan performance not only depends on the borrower and loan information
but also on the overall state of the economy. Based on the theory and results of the relevant
banking literature we consider the following factors, reflecting the health of general economy,
as potential explanatory variables: real GDP growth rate, Unemployment rate, House Price
Index, S&P500 Index and Consumer Sentiment Index.
A lot of studies (e.g. Croux et al., 2020; Louzis et al., 2012; Skarica, 2014) suggest that an
increase in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) positively affects loan quality and decreases the
likelihood of default. Thus, we expect real GDP growth to have a negative effect on
default rate.
The unemployment rate, which is linked to the uncertainty regarding future income, is an
important indicator for signaling borrower solvency and is commonly used to interpret the
default rate. Rise in unemployment rates, can be expected to increase the hazard. Louzis et al.
(2012) argue that unemployment is an important factor that affects consumer NPLs in the
Greek banking sector, implying that an increase in unemployment levels has a negative
impact on borrowers’ ability to settle their obligations. A lot of studies find strong positive
correlation between unemployment and consumers’ delinquency (Mateus, 2020; Tobbak et al.,
2014; Bellotti and Crook, 2009; among others).
In the literature the House Price Index (HPI) has been assessed as a factor that negatively
affect non-performing loans [2]. Usually, a positive shock in house prices results in a fall in
delinquency volume. Ghosh (2015) finds that a rise in housing price reduces NPLs. Crook and
Banasik (2012) concludes that the greater the fall in house prices, the greater the increase in

delinquent debt and Wadud et al. (2020) show that house prices have an adverse and
significant impact on mortgage delinquency rate.
P2P default probability may be affected by the performance of the US equity market. The
impact of such Indices on loan delinquencies was assessed, for example, by Altman et al.
(2005), Ghosh (2017) and Fallanca et al. (2020). A decrease in financial wealth is expected to
increase the borrowers’ probability of defaulting on loans, since the ability to service debts
also decreases. We use historical data from S&P 500 Index [3], which reflects the overall
return characteristics of the stock market as a whole, as a measure of changes in financial
wealth.
Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI) is another important economic indicator and measures
how optimistic consumers are about their financial situation and the overall economic outlook
[4]. The effect of CSI is expected to be ambiguous. Increased households’ optimism is likely to
cause less loan defaults, but high consumer optimism may be expected to increase the
demand for loans and, as a consequence, an increasing debt may lead to high levels of loan
delinquencies. Mateus (2020) reports that an increase in consumer sentiment causes
delinquency to decrease in auto loans, credit cards, mortgages and student loans in the USA.
Table A2 presents the macroeconomic variables, their sources and the expected signs.
The probability of default for a P2P loan can be described through the following equation:
D ¼ β0 þ β1loan amnt þ β2term þ β3grade þ β4emp length þ β5home ownership
þ β6annual inc þ β7purpose þ β8edti þ β9deling 2yrs þ β10unq last 6mths

þ β19UR þ β20S&P500 þ β21CSI þ ε
(1)
Here, D is a binary variable and represents probability of default (1 if the funded loan has been
defaulted and 0 otherwise). Equation (1) analyzes the determinants of probability of default.
4.2 Descriptive statistics
Table 4 reports the summary statistics for all variables used in this study. Their number,
mean, extreme values and median are reported.
Table A3 shows the correlation matrix table (Pearson’s correlation coefficients) of all non-
categorical variables. We can observe that the chosen independent variables are not highly
correlated to each other and multicollinearity problems do not arise.
4.3 Empirical results
We first carry out non-parametric test in order to examine if there are differences in the
chosen variables between two subsamples of loan status (“Charged off” and “Fully paid”).
The Mann–Whitney U (Wilcoxon rank sum) test is used for comparing the two groups, where
the null hypothesis is that the two samples come from identical populations (i.e. have the same
median). Table A4 shows the results of the non-parametric test. We see that there are
statistically significant differences between two groups and thus the null hypothesis is
rejected. To further determine the exact effect of one of each variable on the probability of a
P2P loan to default, we perform 3 logistic regression models. The estimation results of the
models are reported in Table 5. Model 1 uses the variables provided by LendingClub
(individual borrower and loan characteristics), model 2 contains only the macroeconomic
Factors
determining
default in P2P
lending

variables (exogenous economic factors) and the overall model 3 uses all the explicative
variables.
Firstly, we use goodness-of-fit measures by means of the Hosmer–Lemeshow test and the
method of Akaike information criterion (AIC) to compare the 3 models and determine which
one is the best fit for the data. Both of them indicate that the model 3 is the most adequate in
explaining the status loans. Consequently, the inclusion of macroeconomic variables clearly
improves our model.
The majority of independent variables in model 3 are statistically significant at 1% level in
explaining the probability of a loan default and indicate the expected association (positive or
negative) with the dependent variable. The delinquency probability for a typical P2P loan can
be determined using the Odds ratio reported. Credit grade is an important factor determining
loan performance and default likelihood. As expected, the lower the credit grate the riskier the
loan. The results show a descending order from A (low risk borrowers) to G (high risk
borrowers). The estimated exponentiated coefficients for each credit grade are significant at
the 1% level. The variable with the highest predictive capability of all in the study is one
reporting whether a borrower was assigned with grade A. Going up from grade B to grade A
is associated with a decrease of almost 80% in the odds of becoming a defaulted loan.
Another important factor determining the loan outcome is the self-recorded loan purpose.
The default probability is high in loans used for small business funding, medical and moving
purposes, while loans for wedding expenditures, car purchase and credit card bear lower
default risk, with the odds ratio being 0.9213, 0.8541 and 0.9694 respectively.

Table 5.
Binary logistic
regression results of
loan default
Factors
determining
default in P2P
lending

The loan amount is positively correlated with loan default. The higher the loan amount the
higher the probability of default on a P2P loan. However, the influence of this factor seems to
be quite low. This finding is similar to results in Polena and Regner (2018) study.
The annual income positively and significantly affects the probability of a loan success.
Borrowers with high annual income are less likely to default. The odds ratio is 0.8061,
suggesting that for one unit increase in the annual income we expect to see a decrease of about
20% in the odds of defaults.
Debt-to-income (dti) ratio and number of 30þ days past-due incidences of delinquency in
the last two years are positive determinants of the likelihood of borrowers’ default. These
results are consistent with Croux et al. (2020), who also find that borrowers with higher dti or
with a higher number of credit inquiries are more likely to default.
One more open credit line in the borrower’s credit file reduces the loan default probability,
with odds ratio being 0.99 (1% percent reduction in the odds ratio). The coefficient of the
number of inquiries in six months are interpreted on the same basis. This is in accordance
with the study of M€ollenkamp (2017), although in the conclusion of his analysis the influence
of the two variables were even stronger.
The factor number of charge offs during last year has a positive and statistically
significant impact on default. The higher the number of charge offs within 12 months, the
higher the likelihood of a P2P loan default.
The housing situation is a significant predictor for borrowers’ default. The indicator of
whether a borrower is a homeowner shows high economic significance and decreases the odds
of delinquent behavior. On the contrary, borrowers who rent their home have a higher risk of
default. This result agrees with Croux et al. (2020) and Polena and Regner (2018) findings.
Study’s results also show that short-term loans (36 months) are associated with a lower
likelihood of default. This finding is in congruence with the study of Durovic (2017) who also
found positive relation between loan maturity and default risk. In contrast, as the
employment length of the borrower increases the odds of loan success.
The macroeconomic variables, that this research mainly focuses on, are statistically
important and strongly impact the likelihood of loan being default.
The most important macroeconomic determinant for increasing the odds of loan default is
unemployment rate. A positive increase of about 18% in the odds of becoming a loan
defaulted is expected when the proportion of the population in unemployment increases one
percent. The finding of a strong negative impact of unemployment rate on P2P loan quality is
consistent with the existing financial literature (e.g. Carmichael, 2014; Fallanca et al., 2020).
The coefficient of GDP growth rate is statistically significant but, surprisingly, it indicates
positive relationship with loan defaults, implying that an improvement in the growth of GDP
results in a higher likelihood of delinquency. Our findings contradicts, apparently, several
empirical results, such as those in the study of Croux et al. (2020), who indicates a negative
relationship between GDP growth rate and delinquency of P2P loans. Louzis et al. (2012), also,
show that consumer and mortgage NPLs are negatively related to the GDP growth rate. The
finding of our study in the light of the above could be attributed to the explanation that the
high economy growth may be increase the demand for P2P loans and an increasing debt in
the economy may lead to high default rates in the long run.
Our study is the first in the marketplace lending market studies that examine the impact of
HPI, CSI and S&P500 Index on default probability of P2P loans.
Changes in HPI seems to have impact on default. The higher the growth rate of HPI at the
time a loan is originated the lower the likelihood of a borrower to default. A 1% increase in
HPI is associated with a 0.06% points reduction in the odds of loan default. This magnitude is
comparable to a previous result from Bofondi and Ropele (2011). They explore the macro
factors affecting household and business loans in Italy and find that an increase in HPI by 1%
is associated with a decrease of 0.27% in new bad loans ratio.
JES

Consistent with previous studies in traditional finance, the results of model 3 show that
there is a negative relationship between CSI and likelihood of default. Mateus (2020)
examining the factors impact the delinquency rates of auto loans, credit cards, mortgages and
student loans in the United States, finds that consumer optimism has significant and negative
effect on loan quality. Wadud et al. (2020), find that consumers’ sentiment in the American
states reduces mortgages and automobile delinquencies, whereas raises credit card loan
defaults. Fuinhas et al. (2019) claims, however, that there is a positive relationship between
consumers’ sentiment and the proportion of student borrowers in delinquency or default.
Finally, the S&P500 Index is negatively associated with defaults. Although the magnitude
is not strong this finding indicates that the positive percentage change in the annual returns
of the Index lowers the likelihood the P2P borrower will default. This finding falls in line with
the study of Mateus (2020) who argue that the S&P500 is statistically significant and has a
negative effect on delinquency of credit cards. A similar negative relation for the real estate
loans has been found in the empirical work of Fallanca et al. (2020).
5. Concluding remarks
The probability of default, as a cornerstone of credit risk, is the most central issue when the
performance of P2P loans is assessed. Information asymmetry between lenders and borrowers
remains an important problem existing in marketplace lending. Analysis of the determinants of
loan default can significantly help investors make more accurate assessment for borrowers’
credit riskiness and may resolve the issues of adverse selection and moral hazard.
This research examines the default determinants of P2P loans using an extended dataset
of almost 2 million loans with clear ending resolution issued through the LendingClub from
2007 to 2020Q3, the longest analyzed period compared to previous corresponding studies. We
investigate the impact of loan and borrower characteristics together with macroeconomic
factors on P2P loan delinquencies utilizing logistic regression analysis. A binary logistic
model of a total of 21 explanatory variables is proposed to predict loan default.
Our results, consistent with previous studies, confirm that loan and borrower information
can indeed predict the likelihood of loan default.
Except from loan and borrower’s characteristics, research interest during the last few
years has begun to turn to exogenous economic conditions. Recent studies include
macroeconomic factors to explain the reasons that lead P2P borrowers to default. Empirical
evidence show that default is influenced by factors such as inflation, interest rate, GDP
growth, Unemployment rate and VIX Index. Our findings, in line with existing studies, show
that the Unemployment rate positively and significantly influence loan default. Higher
unemployment rates is linked to higher default rates.
However, the novelty of our study is that we introduced HPI, S&P Index and CSI as drivers
that explain the defaults in P2P lending market. Consistent with theoretical predictions of
traditional financial market literature, our findings reveal significant impact of HPI, CSI and
S&P500 Index on likelihood of P2P default. Higher percentage change in HPI, CSI and S&P500
Index in the year of a loan issued seems to be associated with a lower probability of delinquency.
To sum up, this study contributes to the growing literature by providing a deeper
understanding of the predictors of loan default. The empirical findings reveal that alternative data
should be utilized to identify borrowers’ creditworthiness. Macroeconomic factors play an
important role in borrowers’ delinquency and should be taken into consideration when assessing
credit risk. There are important implications of our findings for researchers, lenders and policy
makers.
When evaluating borrowers’ riskiness to default, data on the country’s economic situation
should also be used so that the lender can identify good borrowers from subprime ones and make
profitable credit decisions. This study can encourage further research in the field of P2P lending
