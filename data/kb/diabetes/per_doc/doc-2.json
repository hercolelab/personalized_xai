The outcomes were T2DM and HT, and the exposure was skinfold thickness measured in bicipital, tricipital, subscapular and suprailiac areas. The Durnin–Womersley formula and SIRI equation were used for body fat percentage estimation. Risk ratios and population attributable fractions (PAF) were calculated using Poisson regression.\nSetting: Rural (Ayacucho) and urban shantytown district (San Juan de Miraflores, Lima) in Peru.\nParticipants: Adults (n 988) aged ≥30 years (rural, rural-to-urban migrants, urban) completed the baseline study. A total of 785 and 690 were included in T2DM and HT incidence analysis, respectively.\nResults: At baseline, age mean was 48·0 (SD 12·0) years and 47 % were males. For T2DM, in 7·6 (SD 1·3) years, sixty-one new cases were identified, overall incidence of 1·0 (95 % CI 0·8, 1·3) per 100 person-years. Bicipital and subscapular skinfolds were associated with 2·8-fold and 6·4-fold risk of developing T2DM. On the other hand, in 6·5 (SD 2·5) years, overall incidence of HT was 2·6 (95 % CI 2·2, 3·1) per 100 person-years. Subscapular and overall fat obesity were associated with 2·4- and 2·9-fold risk for developing HT. The PAF for subscapular skinfold was 73·6 and 39·2 % for T2DM and HT, respectively.\nConclusions: We found a strong association between subscapular skinfold thickness and developing T2DM and HT.

Skinfold assessment can be a laboratory-free strategy to identify high-risk HT and T2DM cases.\nKeywords: Type 2 diabetes mellitus; Hypertension; Skinfold thickness; Obesity\nIntroduction\nIn 2016, nearly 18 million deaths were caused by CVD, accounting for one-third of the global deaths. In the last decade, the impact of the increasing prevalence of non-communicable diseases has been observed in low- and middle-income countries, where approximately 75 % of the global deaths related to CVD occurred. Hypertension (HT) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are the strongest modifiable risk factors for CVD and the subsequent mortality. HT is the main risk factor for CVD, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the total deaths associated with non-communicable diseases. On the other hand, US 827 billion are expended annually in patients with T2DM worldwide.\nA common major risk factor for CVD is obesity, with a global prevalence among adults of 13 % in 2016. The WHO defines obesity as an excess of body fat and recommends using BMI to assess it, as BMI is a simple tool to use in routine clinical examinations. However, BMI does not differentiate fat percentage from lean mass. Therefore, the obesity diagnosis obtained by it is not necessarily correlated with body fat percentage (BF%), which is associated with CVD or metabolic disturbances. Waist circumference (WC) is another anthropometric marker with a demonstrated association with T2DM and HT and represents the abdominal fat and android distribution of fat. The gold standards to quantify BF% as well as describe its distribution are dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and skinfold thickness assessment. Skinfold thickness, being one of the recommended standards for excess of BF %, remains understudied in its relationship with major cardiometabolic risk factors such as T2DM and HT. In terms of longitudinal evaluations, only two studies from developing countries have explored the association between skinfold thickness results and developing T2DM, and only one of these considered HT as an additional outcome.\nAccordingly, we aimed to determine the association between excess of body fat, estimated by skinfold thickness using four different regions (i.e. bicipital, tricipital, subscapular, suprailiac), and the risk of developing T2DM and HT using",

We hypothesized that excess of BF % according to skinfold thickness would demonstrate a greater association with T2DM and HT than that observed with traditional anthropometric markers.\nMethods\nStudy design\nWe analysed data from the PERU MIGRANT Study, a prospective ongoing cohort for which baseline assessment was conducted in 2007–2008. Two follow-ups were carried out, the first one in 2012–2013 and the other during 2015–2016.\nSettings and participants\nAt baseline, individuals aged ≥30 years who reported living permanently in the selected rural and urban areas were invited to participate in the study after a single-stage random sampling method. Rural dwellers were recruited from the district of San Jose de Secce in Huanta, Ayacucho. Rural-to-urban migrants and urban dwellers were selected from Las Pampas de San Juan de Miraflores, Lima. Participants unable to consent and pregnant women were excluded.\nEnrolment at baseline was made through a single-stage random sampling technique. In San Jose de Secce, the rural site, a census was conducted in 2007. In the case of Lima, the urban area, a local census was updated in that year. Those who were born and lived permanently in Las Pampas de San Juan de Miraflores, Lima, were included in the urban group, whereas those who reported to permanently live in Las Pampas de San Juan de Miraflores at the time of the baseline assessment but were born in Ayacucho were considered in the migrant group. A face-to-face administered questionnaire as well as clinical and laboratory assessments were conducted to obtain data related to CVD risk profile and sociodemographic characteristics. Only those with completed information were included in the cohort baseline, resulting in an overall response rate of 61·6 % (989/1606). Participants were re-evaluated during follow-up assessments by contacting them in the settings where they were originally enrolled in the study.\nDefinition of variables\nOutcome variables\nThe two outcomes of interest were T2DM and HT.

In the follow-up assessment, new cases of T2DM were considered only when the participant accomplished the first two diagnostic criteria we used at baseline. The laboratory method used for plasma glucose measurement was the enzymatic colorimetric (GOD-PAP, Modular P-E/Roche-Cobas, Grenzach-Whylen, Germany) for 5 ml of whole blood.\nAt baseline, all cases of HT were defined by: the average of the last two of three measurements of systolic blood pressure (≥140 mmHg) or diastolic blood pressure (≥90 mmHg) in the clinical assessment, the participant’s self-report of HT diagnosis done by a physician, or currently receiving antihypertensive medication. New cases of HT identified in the first and second follow-up were determined by using only the first two criteria, as the antihypertensive medication data did not provide more information.\nExposure variables\nExcess body fat, measured only at baseline, was defined as the exposure variable according to each skinfold measurement. Four different areas of the body (i.e. bicipital, tricipital, subscapular, suprailiac) were measured in triplicate in millimetres and assessed by the same fieldworker using a Holtain Tanner/Whitehouse Skinfold Caliper calibrated to the nearest 0·2 mm. The average of the three measures for each skinfold was calculated and utilized for further estimations. The Durnin–Womersley density formula was used to estimate the body density according to each skinfold measurement as well as the overall fat obesity, defined as the total sum of all the four skinfolds.

Additionally, non-healthy behavioural risk factors were also assessed. Physical activity was assessed through the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Levels in MET-min/week were categorized into low and medium/high (where MET is metabolic equivalent of task). Heavy drinking was defined as either the self-report of having a hangover or having ≥6 drinks on the same occasion at least once per month.

Two regression models adjusted by different confounders were developed. Model 1 adjusted for sex, age, education, assets index, population group, heavy drinking, currently daily smoking and physical activity. Model 2 adjusted for everything in model 1 plus BMI. In addition, population attributable fraction (PAF) was also calculated using the ‘punaf’ command in Stata and compared between models.\nResults\nCharacteristics of the study population at baseline\nAt the baseline enrolment, 988 participants completed the study.

PAF due to subscapular fat was greater than for other common anthropometric measurements such as BMI, WC and WHtR.

Our findings provide evidence favouring the utility of measuring skinfolds as a laboratory-free marker for the risk of T2DM in non-specialist and low-resource settings.\nUpper-body fat, known as truncal fat, has been associated with an increased insulin resistance among men. Many markers of insulin secretion and its metabolism have been studied according to fat distribution. These studies have indicated that visceral and upper-body fat are more related to the release of NEFA and their accumulation in the liver, which subsequently leads to glucose metabolism impairment and even cardiovascular mortality. Few observational studies have approached the relationship between subscapular skinfold thickness and the risk of developing T2DM. Of these studies, only three were prospective in nature. Mensik et al. reported that a greater subscapular skinfold thickness was more strongly associated with the risk of transient and persistent impaired glucose tolerance after 4 months of follow-up compared with BMI, WC and the sum of all skinfold measurements. However, Chei et al. questioned this association, as only a marginal significant risk for T2DM and HT was found. Data regarding physical activity and sociodemographic characteristics were not available in this latter report, leaving room to better assess the association by including further confounders as we did herein. Sosenko et al. noted a strong association between subscapular skinfold thickness and non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Compared with BMI and WHtR, subscapular skinfold thickness was superiorly associated with T2DM, even after controlling for sex.\nSome studies suggest that the relationship between insulin secretion and high-carbohydrate diets, which are particularly common in Peru and other Latin American countries, varies according to phenotype and body fat distribution. The positive association between abdominal obesity and T2DM is clear and seems to be stronger when other criteria of the metabolic syndrome (e.g. high cholesterol) are present. Moreover, in patients with a history of vascular disease, WC has a positive association with T2DM risk. A diet rich in carbohydrates would increase the abdominal perimeter, leading to high levels of inflammation markers related to T2DM, such as IL-6, complement factor C3 and C-reactive protein.

In Asian populations, WC has been associated not only with T2DM but also with diabetic retinopathy. Among Hispanics, data are limited. Mexican populations had greater levels of insulin secretion after oral glucose intake unlike to white counterparts. Finally, truncal fat is linked to parental history of T2DM, which is also an established risk factor for T2DM. Overall, the assessment of body fat distribution could play an important role in T2DM screening and follow-up.\nSkinfold thickness measurements as predictor of hypertension\nData regarding the association between skinfold thickness and HT are even more limited. To our knowledge, there is only one study addressing this association prospectively. The Kaunas Cardiovascular Cohort Risk Study conducted in Lithuania showed that an increased skinfold thickness measured in childhood was not associated with HT in adulthood, after 35 years of follow-up. There are chemical changes during adolescence that may explain why skinfold thickness assessed during childhood might not reflect final fat distribution in adulthood. In addition, studies in twins have reported that BMI and skinfolds vary with age and sex independently of heritability, and that skinfold thickness measurements performed in childhood actually overestimate BF%. Our study focused only on adults and demonstrated the long-term effect of body fat distribution on blood pressure outcomes.\nA few cross-sectional studies, mainly in children, have considered skinfold thickness measurements as exposure variables while assessing HT or blood pressure as outcomes. Khadilkar et al. found a relevant association between higher blood pressure and tricipital skinfold thickness in children aged 5–17 years. Ying-Xiu et al. assessed upper-body fat as the sum of tricipital and subscapular skinfold thicknesses, obtaining similar results in 12-year-old children. Okosun et al. found that truncal obesity, abdominal obesity and their co-occurrence had higher odds of HT, especially in adult women. Our longitudinal study confirms these associations.

In that sense, our results are physiologically compatible with previous studies where subscapular, suprailiac and tricipital skinfold thickness had associations with standard indicators of organ damage due to HT.\nOur findings suggest that body fat located in the subscapular area is a risk factor for developing T2DM and HT. Thus, subscapular skinfold thickness measurement could be used as an individual potential tool or part of a risk score to identify individuals at high risk for developing T2DM and HT. In addition to BMI, WHtR and overall fat obesity could be also used as a screening tool for HT. In resource-limited settings, where laboratory analysis is not always included in the minimal health insurance package, these anthropometric parameters could provide a cost-effective and individualized approach identify and monitor patients at risk for developing either of these two conditions.\nRegardless of the setting, inserting some skinfold parameters may improve the surveillance and screening of CVD risk factors by identifying individuals at high risk for developing T2DM and HT. The strong association and high PAF percentages from subscapular skinfold thickness support the utility of using this anthropometric marker as part of the general clinical evaluation in adults.\nStrengths and limitations\nThe PERU MIGRANT Cohort Study has three well-defined sociodemographic groups, controlling our models by urbanization exposure as in previous studies. In addition, our regression analysis allows us to pursue PAF of all the anthropometric measurements and compare them.\nNevertheless, our study remained with limitations that should be declared. First, potential misclassification of T2DM cases can arise because oral glucose tolerance was not used as diagnostic method. However, our main findings will not change since the under-diagnosis of T2DM would have a negative impact in the strength of the associations, which implies that risk of developing T2DM would be even greater.

Nevertheless, we recognize potential additional bias due to variation of body fat during the observation period, which was not assessed periodically by skinfold thickness. Finally, data regarding diet were not collected, representing a potential but minimal bias because of its relationship with body fat distribution according to the intake of simple and complex carbohydrates and saturated fat, which typically accumulates in WC. Therefore, further studies are needed to address the impact of diet patterns.\nConclusions\nThere is evidence of a strong association between subscapular and overall fat obesity assessed through skinfold thickness and the risk of developing T2DM and HT. Moreover, after adjusting for obesity according to BMI, which is used the most in daily clinical practice, subscapular obesity remained as one of the best predictors for T2DM. We remark that BMI and WC, commonly used anthropometric measurements, had lower PAF, particularly for HT. Our findings suggest that skinfold thickness, if used as part of routine assessments, might improve the detection process of T2DM and HT in settings without clinical specialists or accessible laboratory support. Nevertheless, considering the limitations of the skinfold thickness measurements, implementation-type studies are needed in order to disentangle the impact of subscapular skinfold thickness measurement as part of the routine clinical examination in elderly or overweight patients.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are in high debt to the participants from Ayacucho and Lima, who kindly agreed and completed their participation in the study. In addition, they want to recognize and thank the commitment and hard work of all the fieldworkers, especially Lilia Cabrera, Rosa Salirrosas and Marco Varela.\nFinancial support: This study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, through the GloCal Health Fellowship Program from the University of California Global Health Institute and partly under the contract number HHSN268200900033 C.
