We deﬁne\nfour loan risk classes and test the signiﬁcance of the default determining variables within each loan\nrisk class. Our ﬁndings suggest that the signiﬁcance of most variables depends on the loan risk class.\nOnly a few variables are consistently signiﬁcant across all risk classes. The debt-to-income ratio,\ninquiries in the past six months and a loan intended for a small business are positively correlated\nwith the default rate. Annual income and credit card as loan purpose are negatively correlated.\nKeywords: crowdfunding; peer-to-peer lending; P2P; credit grade; FICO score; default risk\nJEL Classiﬁcation: D14; E41; G23\n1. Introduction\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms are new ﬁnancial intermediaries connecting borrowers and\nlenders. Due to technological innovations they facilitate loans with low intermediation costs and thus\npose a threat for traditional banks [1]. Unsurprisingly, the popularity of P2P lending is rising rapidly.\nFor example, Lending Club, the biggest P2P lending platform in the world, almost doubled the amount\nof issued loans from USD 4.4 billion in 2014 to USD 8.4 billion in 2015. The remarkable growth of P2P\nlending is present in Europe [2] as well as in China [3].\nThe fundamental problem of lending is information asymmetry between borrowers and lenders:\nborrowers have more information about their creditworthiness than lenders have. P2P lending\nplatforms try to decrease this information asymmetry. They apply credit scoring techniques and assign\na risk grade to each loan that may serve as a signal for lenders. Indeed, existing research [4–6] ﬁnds\na positive correlation between a loan’s default and the assigned risk grade. They also ﬁnd further\ndeterminants of the default rate, for instance, the debt-to-income ratio or revolving credit utilization.\nWe conjecture that the signiﬁcance of these default determinants depends on the loan’s risk grade.\nThus, the goal of our study is to evaluate known determinants of borrowers’ default for each risk grade\nseparately. We test this with a new data set consisting of 70,673 loan observations from Lending Club.",

Funding Success of P2P Loans\nA number of studies explore what factors contribute to the funding success of P2P loans. Most are\nbased on data from the platform Prosper which used to be the biggest P2P lending platform in the USA.\nProsper had many social features, such as a discussion forum and detailed borrowers’ characteristics\nincluding their photos. Studies, among others, by [11,12], stress the importance of social relationships\nfor funding success. They ﬁnd that borrowers with better social ties are more likely to get their loans\nfunded and to receive a lower interest rate. However, social features were completely removed by\nProsper in 2008.2 Ref. [13] analyze data from the German platform Smava. Their results indicate that\nmen and women are equally likely to get funded.\nSeveral studies focus on herding behavior in P2P lending. Ref. [14] conclude that a 1% increment\nin the number of bids represents a 15% increase of the probability of an additional bid (until the loan is\nfully funded). They also control for borrower/loan characteristics and ﬁnd that the debt-to-income\nratio is negatively correlated with funding, while the credit grade is positively correlated with funding.\nThey ﬁnd no relationship between funding and home ownership or the requested loan amount.\nRef. [15] ﬁnd that lenders observe their peers’ lending decisions and use this information to infer\ncreditworthiness of borrowers. Among their control variables, the debt-to-income ratio is negatively\ncorrelated with funding, while the credit grade, home owner status and the amount requested are\npositively correlated with funding.\n2.2.

Determinants of Borrowers’ Default\nInvesting at P2P lending platforms is a risky activity, because the offered loans are not secured.\nTo decrease the information asymmetry between lender and borrower, borrowers are obliged to provide\nsome personal information, such as annual income or the loan’s purpose. For example, borrowers at\nLending Club are required to provide detailed information about themselves and their credit history.\n1\nTwo reasons for the rapid emergence of P2P lending platforms are put forward in the literature: low intermediation\ncosts [7,8] and credit rationing after the ﬁnancial crisis in 2007/2008 [9].\n2\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ordered P2P lending companies to register their loans as securities and\nprovide them through a bank.\n\nGames 2018, 9, 82\n3 of 17\nP2P lending platforms use this information to assess the likelihood of borrowers’ default and assign\nhim or her an appropriate interest rate with a given grade class.3 It is generally assumed that the better\nthe grade the more likely is the borrower to repay his or her debt.\nThere are several studies, such as [12,17], examining borrowers’ characteristics and their inﬂuence\non borrowers’ default based on data from Prosper. We do not review these studies in detail because\nof the differences between the platforms Prosper and Lending Club.4 Instead, we focus on studies\nexamining borrowers’ default determinants based on Lending Club data: [4–6].\nAll three are in consensus that the Credit Grade5 assigned by Lending Club is the best predictor\nfor borrowers’ default. Moreover, Revolving Credit Line Utilization is another variable inﬂuencing the\ndefault rate mentioned in all three papers. Findings of other default determinants vary. The discrepancy\nbetween the ﬁndings of [4–6] might be caused by three different factors. The ﬁrst factor is the selection\nof variables potentially having an impact on borrowers’ default. For example, Ref. [4,5] found out\nthat the FICO score has an inﬂuence on default. [6] did not choose the FICO score as an independent\nvariable in their study.

The Lending Club Process\nThe Lending Club connects people who want to borrow money with people who are willing to\nlend their money. Before applying for a loan at the Lending Club, a prospective borrower should ﬁnd\nout the value of his/her FICO score which is widely used by banks and credit providers in the USA.6\nThe FICO score represents the creditworthiness of a person. It is computed based on a borrower’s\npersonal credit report provided by national credit bureaus in the USA. The exact formula for the\nFICO score computation is held secret, only approximate weights of given categories are made public.7\nAbout 90% of borrowers’ applications at Lending Club is rejected because of an insufﬁcient FICO\nscore. Only potential borrowers with a FICO score of at least 600 are allowed to apply for a loan at\nLending Club.\nThe potential borrower is further asked to provide some personal and loan information.\nThe self-reported information is his/her Annual Income, the current Home Situation (potential options\nare own, mortgage or rent), the Length of Employment, the Loan Purpose and a Loan Description. All of\nthis information, except Loan Description, are mandatory.\nAfter checking a borrower’s FICO score and his/her self-reported information, Lending Club\nassigns a risk Loan Grade, from A to G, followed by a more accurate risk Loan Subgrade, from A1 to G5,\nand a corresponding interest rate.",

Borrower’s self-reported information are Annual Income,\nHousing Situation, Length of Employment, Loan Amount, Loan Purpose, and Loan Description. The second\nsource of information origin is the borrower’s credit ﬁle provided by one of three national credit\nbureaus in the USA. We choose the following variables from a borrower’s credit ﬁle: Debt−to−Income,\nDelinquency in Past 2 Years, Date of First Credit Line, Inquiries in Past 6 Months, Months since Last\nDelinquency, Months since Last Record, Open Credit Lines, and Revolving Credit Utilization. The description\nof our variables is included in Table A1 in Appendix A.\nWe modiﬁed two variables from the original data set. The ﬁrst variable is Loan Description. It is\nprovided by a borrower when applying for a loan. There are many ways to use Loan Description as an\nindependent variable that might be the predictor for borrowers’ default. For example, Ref. [5] extracted\ntwo dummy variables from Loan Description: Borrower’s Self-Claimed Creditworthiness and Description\nLacking Full Stop. He found that both variables are signiﬁcant for default prediction. Our approach is\ndifferent from [5]. We count the number of characters in Loan Description and call this new variable\nNumber of Characters. The second variable of interest from the original data set that was modiﬁed is\nDate of First Credit Line. It is a variable in the form of ‘month-year’ and represents the reported date of\nthe ﬁrst open credit line. We transformed this variable into the number of years since the ﬁrst reported\ncredit line was opened. The name of this new variable is Length of Credit History.\nThus, our variables are fairly similar to variables used by [4–6]. Unlike these papers though,\nwe do not include information about the Loan Subgrade and the FICO Score. Furthermore, we neither\ninclude the Loan Grade nor the Interest Rate. All these variables are highly correlated, because Loan\nSubgrade, which is more speciﬁc than Loan Grade, is largely based on the FICO score. The interest rate is\nthen assigned based on the Loan Subgrade.\n8\nWe have downloaded the data from the download data section at the Lending Club website.",

Loan Amount is not signiﬁcant in their study but in ours and Open\nCredit Lines is signiﬁcant in theirs but not in ours. Finally, our All Classes results are quite different\nfrom [4]’s results. Besides differences in the time frame of the data set, Ref. [4] include the Loan Credit\nGrade and FICO score as explanatory variables in their regression. A high correlation between FICO\nscore and other variables of interest is to be expected, because the FICO score is computed based on\nthese values. The same may apply to the Loan Grade.\n11\nWe show that loans issued before 2009 have signiﬁcantly higher default rates than loans issued between 2009 and 2012.\n\nGames 2018, 9, 82\n11 of 17\nTable 5.

Given that, on average, 12.5% of all loans default, a one standard deviation\nchange of the Debt-to-Income ratio increases the chances of default by 6%.12 This value increases to 12%\nfor high risk loans.\nAs a robustness check of our loan grade classiﬁcation we merge the two smallest classes, the High\nand Very High-Risk Class, and consider them jointly. All regressors that are signiﬁcant in the High-Risk\nClass are at least as signiﬁcant in the regression speciﬁcation with observations from both risk classes.\nIn addition, the variables Loan Amount and Months since Last Record are positively correlated with\ndefault. The loan purposes Car and Wedding are negatively correlated with default.\nFinally, we address to what extent these insights are taken into account by lenders, when they\ndecide whether to fund a loan or not. For this purpose, we draw on evidence from existing studies\nwho analyze the funding success of P2P loans. According to both [14,15] loans have a higher chance\nto attract funding, the lower the debt-to-income ratio is and the better the credit grade is. Moreover,\nRef.

The beneﬁts of automation can transform into lower interest rates for borrowers\nand higher interest earnings for lenders in comparison to traditional banks.\nHowever, information asymmetries between borrowers and lenders remain a central issue faced\nby P2P lending platforms. Credit scoring techniques are employed to address this. They assign a credit\ngrade to each loan based on the perceived risk of default. Riskier loans are associated with higher\ninterest rates as higher interest rates serve as compensation for a potential loan default.

We conjecture that the signiﬁcance of default determining\nvariables might not be the same in different loan risk classes. In other words, some variables are only\nsigniﬁcant default determinants in speciﬁc loan classes.\nWhile results on our full data set are largely in line with ﬁndings of previous studies, our set of\nseparate regressions for each loan risk class identiﬁes only Annual Income, Debt-to-Income, Inquiries in\nPast 2 Years and the loan purposes Credit Card and Small Business as signiﬁcant determinants of loan\ndefault in all loan risk classes.
