      "text": "This study is motivated by the hypothesis that both P2P loan\ncharacteristics and macroeconomic variables have influence on loan performance. The authors define a set of\nloan characteristics, borrower characteristics and macroeconomic variables that are significant in determining\nthe probability of default and should be taken into consideration when assessing credit risk.\nDesign/methodology/approach – The research question in this study is to find the significant explanatory\nvariables that are essential in determining the probability of default for LendingClub loans. The empirical\nstudy is based on a total number of 1,863,491 loan records issued through LendingClub from 2007 to 2020Q3\nand a logistic regression model is developed to predict loan defaults.\nFindings – The results, in line with prior research, show that a number of borrower and contractual loan\ncharacteristics predict loan defaults. The innovation of this study is the introduction of specific macroeconomic\nindicators. The study indicates that macroeconomic variables assessed alongside loan data can significantly\nimprove the forecasting performance of default model. The general finding demonstrates that higher\npercentage change in House Price Index, Consumer Sentiment Index and S&P500 Index is associated with a\nlower probability of delinquency. The empirical results also exhibit significant positive effect of unemployment\nrate and GDP growth rate on P2P loan default rates.\nPractical implications – Theresultshaveimportantimplications forinvestors forwhomit isof greatimportance\nto know the determinants of borrowers’ creditworthiness and loan performance when estimating the investment in a\ncertain P2P loan. Inaddition, the forecasting performance of the modelcould be appliedby authorities in order to deal\nwith the credit risk in P2P lending and to prevent the effects of increasing defaults on the economy.\nOriginality/value – This paper fulfills an identified need to shed light on the association between specific\nmacroeconomic indicators and the default risk from P2P lending within an economy, while the majority of the\nexisting literature investigate loan and borrower information to evaluate credit risk of P2P loans and predict\nthe likelihood of default.\nKeywords P2P, Marketplace lending, Loan default, United States\nPaper type Research paper\n1.

More specifically, our results show that characteristics explaining\ndefaults are, among others, loan amount, loan maturity, number of delinquency incidences\nand recent credit inquiries. The most important factor of loan performance is the credit grade\nthat is assigned by LendingClub. Higher credit grade loan is associated with lower\ndefault risk.\nOur study aims to extend the P2P literature by investigating specific macroeconomic\nfactors as determinants of default risk. We specifically examine the impact of GDP growth\nrate, Unemployment rate, House Price Index (HPI), Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI) and\nS&P500 Index on borrowers’ probability of default.\nOur results confirm the theoretical predictions, i.e. macroeconomic factors play a crucial\nrole in consumer default. The empirical evidence shows a positive relationship between\nUnemployment rate and an increase in delinquencies and between GDP growth rate and\ndelinquencies. On the other hand, we find that the HPI, CSI and S&P500 Index are negatively\ncorrelated with the defaults. Our results are supported by the literature on banks and\ntraditional financial services (see, e.g. Skarica, 2014; Mateus, 2020; Crook and Banasik, 2012;\nFallanca et al., 2020; Ghosh, 2017). The findings of our empirical study reveal that the\ninclusion of these indicators improves model fit and prediction of default.\nThis paper contributes to the growing literature on P2P lending in two important ways.\nFirstly, this study shed light on the association between specific macroeconomic indicators\nand the default risk from P2P lending within an economy, while the majority of the existing\nliterature investigates loan and borrower information to evaluate credit risk of P2P loans and\npredict the likelihood of default. Secondly, our conclusions are more robust and updated\nsince, unlike previous studies, a more comprehensive dataset of default determinants is used\nspanning 14 years (from 2007 to 2020).\nThe rest of this paper is organized in the following order: Section 2 presents the literature\nreview.",

Literature review\nThe majority of FinTech lending literature has mainly focused on the explanation of the\nemergence and expansion of P2P credit and on the P2P loan performance and default risk.\nBalyuk and Davydenko (2018) document that marketplace lending have evolved from\ntrading venues into credit intermediaries and the most P2P loans being funded by\ninstitutional investors, such as banks. Rau (2020) investigates the determinants of the\ncrowdfunding development and finds that the quality of regulation, the financial system\nJES\n\ninefficiency and the ease of Internet access all provide very robust links to crowdfunding\nvolumes. Havrylchyk et al. (2019) examine the drivers of the expansion of P2P lending in the\nUSA and find evidence that counties that were more affected by financial crisis, with weak\nbanking competition and higher population density have more P2P loans per capita. Oh and\nRosenkranz (2020) find that financial institutions’ efficiency, financial literacy and lower\nbranch and ATM penetration are positively related with the expansion of P2P lending.\nMany researchers examine the risk related to the marketplace lending (see, e.g. K€afer,\n2016; Durovi\u0002c, 2017; Lenz, 2017; Setyaningsih et al., 2019). Suryono et al. (2019) mention six\ncore problems associated to P2P lending, namely information asymmetry, determination of\nborrower credit scores, moral hazard, investment decisions, platform feasibility and\nimmature regulations. Zhao et al. (2021) discuss the credit risk contagion of P2P lending and\nfind that the platform correlations, the susceptible immune rate, the elimination rate of the\nP2P platforms by regulatory agencies, the saturation coefficient and other factors affect the\nrisk contagion in the Internet financial market.\nDi Maggio and Yao (2021), using a consumer credit panel dataset, document that FinTech\nborrowers are more likely to default and exhibit higher indebtedness than borrowers from\ntraditional financial institutions.",

Lots of studies in the FinTech literature focus on the\ndeterminants of P2P loan default by examining the performance of these loans. Most of these\nstudies explore loan and borrower characteristics to evaluate credit risk of P2P loans and\npredict the likelihood of default (see, e.g. Carmichael, 2014; M€ollenkamp, 2017). Serrano-Cinca\net al. (2015), using a sample of 24,449 loans, issued through LendingClub from 2008 until 2014\nfind that factors that best explain default are loan purpose, annual income, current housing\nsituation and indebtedness. They conclude that credit grade has the highest predictive\nprobability, but their model can be improved by including other factors. Similarly, Jagtiani\nand Lemieux (2019) find that the assigned rating grades perform well in predicting loan\nperformance over the two years after origination. Emekter et al. (2015) indicates that credit\nscore, debt-to-income (DTI) ratio and FICO score play an important role in loan defaults.\nDurovi\u0002c (2017) analyzes two loan characteristics, loan term length and loan purpose and finds\nthat longer term loans are more risky than the shorter term ones and the least risky loans are\nthose used for credit card payoff.\nPolena and Regner (2018) define four loan risk classes (based on the assigned credit grade)\nand find that the borrower’s and loan’s information that identified as determinants for default\nin previous studies are only significant in specific loan classes. Chen et al. (2022) use\ntransaction data from LendingClub originated from 2015 until 2018 to estimate the gross rate\nof return (ROR) on an individual loan base and their results reveal that borrowers’ credit\nrating, loan interest rate, loan status and paid-month are the most critical factors to influence\ninvestors’ ROR.\nLots of studies in banking literature show that economic conditions play a crucial role in\nconsumer delinquency and thus should be taken into consideration when assessing loan\nperformance.

Table 3 shows loans temporal distribution\namong the seven credit grades. The majority (29.4% of total loans) of issued loans belong to\ngrade B, closely followed by credit grade C (28.4%).

There are more than 100 variables in the data set of\nLendingClub, but not all are of interest for our analysis. Our variables were selected based on\nthe results of previous studies on P2P default behavior and have been proved to play essential\nrole in borrower solvency. Table A1 summarizes the P2P variables explanation. Except for\nterm, grade, employment length, home ownership and loan purpose, all the other variables are\ncontinuous.\nWe expect that loan performance not only depends on the borrower and loan information\nbut also on the overall state of the economy.

The higher the number of charge offs within 12 months, the\nhigher the likelihood of a P2P loan default.\nThe housing situation is a significant predictor for borrowers’ default. The indicator of\nwhether a borrower is a homeowner shows high economic significance and decreases the odds\nof delinquent behavior. On the contrary, borrowers who rent their home have a higher risk of\ndefault. This result agrees with Croux et al. (2020) and Polena and Regner (2018) findings.\nStudy’s results also show that short-term loans (36 months) are associated with a lower\nlikelihood of default. This finding is in congruence with the study of Durovi\u0002c (2017) who also\nfound positive relation between loan maturity and default risk. In contrast, as the\nemployment length of the borrower increases the odds of loan success.\nThe macroeconomic variables, that this research mainly focuses on, are statistically\nimportant and strongly impact the likelihood of loan being default.\nThe most important macroeconomic determinant for increasing the odds of loan default is\nunemployment rate. A positive increase of about 18% in the odds of becoming a loan\ndefaulted is expected when the proportion of the population in unemployment increases one\npercent. The finding of a strong negative impact of unemployment rate on P2P loan quality is\nconsistent with the existing financial literature (e.g. Carmichael, 2014; Fallanca et al., 2020).\nThe coefficient of GDP growth rate is statistically significant but, surprisingly, it indicates\npositive relationship with loan defaults, implying that an improvement in the growth of GDP\nresults in a higher likelihood of delinquency. Our findings contradicts, apparently, several\nempirical results, such as those in the study of Croux et al. (2020), who indicates a negative\nrelationship between GDP growth rate and delinquency of P2P loans. Louzis et al. (2012), also,\nshow that consumer and mortgage NPLs are negatively related to the GDP growth rate. The\nfinding of our study in the light of the above could be attributed to the explanation that the\nhigh economy growth may be increase the demand for P2P loans and an increasing debt in\nthe economy may lead to high default rates in the long run.",

The higher the growth rate of HPI at the\ntime a loan is originated the lower the likelihood of a borrower to default. A 1% increase in\nHPI is associated with a 0.06% points reduction in the odds of loan default. This magnitude is\ncomparable to a previous result from Bofondi and Ropele (2011). They explore the macro\nfactors affecting household and business loans in Italy and find that an increase in HPI by 1%\nis associated with a decrease of 0.27% in new bad loans ratio.\nJES\n\nConsistent with previous studies in traditional finance, the results of model 3 show that\nthere is a negative relationship between CSI and likelihood of default. Mateus (2020)\nexamining the factors impact the delinquency rates of auto loans, credit cards, mortgages and\nstudent loans in the United States, finds that consumer optimism has significant and negative\neffect on loan quality. Wadud et al. (2020), find that consumers’ sentiment in the American\nstates reduces mortgages and automobile delinquencies, whereas raises credit card loan\ndefaults. Fuinhas et al. (2019) claims, however, that there is a positive relationship between\nconsumers’ sentiment and the proportion of student borrowers in delinquency or default.\nFinally, the S&P500 Index is negatively associated with defaults. Although the magnitude\nis not strong this finding indicates that the positive percentage change in the annual returns\nof the Index lowers the likelihood the P2P borrower will default. This finding falls in line with\nthe study of Mateus (2020) who argue that the S&P500 is statistically significant and has a\nnegative effect on delinquency of credit cards. A similar negative relation for the real estate\nloans has been found in the empirical work of Fallanca et al. (2020).\n5. Concluding remarks\nThe probability of default, as a cornerstone of credit risk, is the most central issue when the\nperformance of P2P loans is assessed. Information asymmetry between lenders and borrowers\nremains an important problem existing in marketplace lending. Analysis of the determinants of\nloan default can significantly help investors make more accurate assessment for borrowers’\ncredit riskiness and may resolve the issues of adverse selection and moral hazard.",

We\ninvestigate the impact of loan and borrower characteristics together with macroeconomic\nfactors on P2P loan delinquencies utilizing logistic regression analysis. A binary logistic\nmodel of a total of 21 explanatory variables is proposed to predict loan default.\nOur results, consistent with previous studies, confirm that loan and borrower information\ncan indeed predict the likelihood of loan default.\nExcept from loan and borrower’s characteristics, research interest during the last few\nyears has begun to turn to exogenous economic conditions. Recent studies include\nmacroeconomic factors to explain the reasons that lead P2P borrowers to default. Empirical\nevidence show that default is influenced by factors such as inflation, interest rate, GDP\ngrowth, Unemployment rate and VIX Index. Our findings, in line with existing studies, show\nthat the Unemployment rate positively and significantly influence loan default. Higher\nunemployment rates is linked to higher default rates.\nHowever, the novelty of our study is that we introduced HPI, S&P Index and CSI as drivers\nthat explain the defaults in P2P lending market. Consistent with theoretical predictions of\ntraditional financial market literature, our findings reveal significant impact of HPI, CSI and\nS&P500 Index on likelihood of P2P default. Higher percentage change in HPI, CSI and S&P500\nIndex in the year of a loan issued seems to be associated with a lower probability of delinquency.\nTo sum up, this study contributes to the growing literature by providing a deeper\nunderstanding of the predictors of loan default. The empirical findings reveal that alternative data\nshould be utilized to identify borrowers’ creditworthiness. Macroeconomic factors play an\nimportant role in borrowers’ delinquency and should be taken into consideration when assessing\ncredit risk.
