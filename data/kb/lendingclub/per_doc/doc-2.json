This is an important\nissue because in P2P lending individual investors bear the credit risk, instead of financial\ninstitutions, which are experts in dealing with this risk. P2P lenders suffer a severe problem\nof information asymmetry, because they are at a disadvantage facing the borrower. For this\nreason, P2P lending sites provide potential lenders with information about borrowers and\ntheir loan purpose. They also assign a grade to each loan. The empirical study is based on\nloans’ data collected from Lending Club (N = 24,449) from 2008 to 2014 that are first ana-\nlyzed by using univariate means tests and survival analysis. Factors explaining default are\nloan purpose, annual income, current housing situation, credit history and indebtedness.\nSecondly, a logistic regression model is developed to predict defaults. The grade assigned\nby the P2P lending site is the most predictive factor of default, but the accuracy of the model\nis improved by adding other information, especially the borrower’s debt level.\nIntroduction\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) lending consists in individuals lending money to other individuals, without\nthe intermediation of a financial institution. P2P can be analyzed under several approaches. It\ncan be considered as an example of financial disintermediation [1], [2]; as another technologi-\ncal disruption provoked by Internet [3]; as a case of collaborative economy [4], or even as a\nplatform to give loans to financially excluded people [5]. Although no traditional bank is pres-\nent in the process, there is an electronic lending platform that mediates between borrowers and\nlenders of loans, charging a fee for this service [6]. Companies such as Prosper or Lending Club\nchannel loans between individuals, whereas Kiva is focused on funding low-income people.\nP2P growth is remarkable, both in the number of loans and the number of investors, attracted\nby high returns expectations or socially responsible investment concerns [7], [8], [9].\nThe first research question of this paper aims at analyzing factors explaining default in P2P\nlending. P2P lending companies provide information on borrowers’ characteristics and loan\npurpose. Hence, each loan is rated with a grade that tries to capture the risk of default and thus\ninvestors can make their choices.",

In other words, if lenders should be only focused on interest rates or\nwhether they should analyze additional factors. The empirical study uses data from Lending\nClub, the biggest US P2P lending company. The sample analyzed contains 24,449 loans.\nAlthough there is available information on all the funded loans from 2008 to 2014, only loans\nfunded until 2011 can be analyzed, because the status of later loans (defaulted or non-\ndefaulted) is still unknown. This happens because the minimum maturity of Lending Club\nloans is 36 months. For example, the status of a loan funded in September 2012 with 36 months\nmaturity, cannot be known until September 2015. Hypotheses have been tested by using uni-\nvariate means tests and survival analysis.\nIt is not only interesting to know factors explaining P2P loan default, but also to accurately\npredict loan defaults. The second research question presents a mathematical model to assess\nthe predictive capability of the factors analyzed. There are several statistical techniques for\ncredit scoring and default prediction, such as discriminant analysis, logistic regression, neural\nnetworks or classification trees, among others. Logistic regression is the most widespread tech-\nnique, because it combines a high predictive capability with accuracy percentages not statisti-\ncally significant different from other more recent techniques [10]. Classification techniques\nassign a 0 to defaulted loans and a 1 to non-defaulted loans. Explanation requires only cross\nvalidation whereas prediction requires intertemporal validation [11]. To do so, a primary sam-\nple is needed, called train sample, and to validate results, a test or holdout sample. The best out-\ncome would be that the test sample will be gathered at a later time than the train sample, to\nensure intertemporal validation. This has been done in this paper.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study explaining defaults in the Lending Club\nplatform, using a database large enough to extract a holdout sample. Until recently, this was\nnot possible due to data availability on the loan status. Our results show that, the higher the\ninterest rate, the higher the probability of default is.

Finally, conclusions are presented.\nLiterature Review\nP2P lending is a type of marketplace that connects the supply and demand of money through\nthe Internet. Bachmann et al. [12] and Berger and Gleisner [6] review the history of P2P. It can\nbe questioned whether it will become a disruptive innovation, as defined by [13], but it is clear\nthat P2P lending is quickly spreading globally [14]. LendingClub issued $3.5 billion in loans in\n2014, an important figure that nearly doubles the $1.9 billion of the previous year. But it is still\nfar away from the data of any traditional bank, and it represents a small percentage compared\nto the $3.3 trillion in US consumer debt outstanding reported by the US Federal Reserve Sys-\ntem in 2014 (see http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/).\nFinancial intermediation theory justifies P2P growth [7], [8], [9]. Financial intermediation\nis firstly explained by transactions costs [15]. Both conventional financial institutions and P2P\nDeterminants of Default in P2P Lending\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0139427\nOctober 1, 2015\n2 / 22\n\nlending bear customer evaluation costs before the loan is approved. Once the loan is approved,\nthey also carry costs involved in monitoring loan payment as well as loan recovery costs [16].\nHowever, P2P lending can lower other intermediation costs.

It does not experience financial frictions due to the coexistence of long term\nloans and short term deposits. Finally, although the use of Internet is not only for P2P lending,\nbut also for online banking, automation reduces manual processes that would otherwise\nincrease efficiency. Operating cost is the most important factor explaining interest margins in\nbanking [17] and banks pass on their operating costs to their depositors and lenders [18]. This\nlow intermediation costs could be transferred to clients in the form of higher revenues for lend-\ners and lower interest rates for borrowers, compared to conventional financial institutions.\nP2P lending sites also offer solutions to other formal credit market problem, credit ration-\ning, which can explain their growth [19]. Market equilibrium equals supply and demand; if\nprices work, credit rationing should not exist, but it does exist [20]. Credit rationing means\nthat some loan applicants may not receive a loan, even if they are willing to pay a high interest\nrate [20]. Credit rationing increases considerably in economic downturns [21]. Dehejia, Mont-\ngomery and Morduch [22] argue that financially excluded people seek access to credit, despite\nhaving to pay a high price. There are even socially responsible P2P platforms, where borrowers\ncan obtain a loan to be reimbursed without paying interests; here, lenders are socially responsi-\nble investors. For example, Kivazip.org facilitates loans at 0% interest rate directly to entrepre-\nneurs via mobile payments. But most financial entities try to follow the Pareto’s 80/20 principle\nwhen giving loans. More precisely, Hales [23] found that only 15% of all financial entities cus-\ntomers were profitable; in fact, fewer than 10% of bank’s clients produce 90% of its profits.\nManagement manuals report similar figures [24].

A priori, this is the less profitable part of the business because the fixed costs of\ndealing with small loans. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems are a practical\nimplementation of Pareto’s principle in banks [25]. By using CRMs, banks group clients into\nseveral categories: from highly profitable to dispensable customers. Emekter, Tu, Jirasakuldech\nand Lu [26], by analyzing credit risk in P2P lending, find that borrowers with higher incomes\nand potentially higher scores do not participate in these markets. P2P operates in the long tail\nof small size loans. There are two strategies to obtain profits in the long tail. The first one is\nbased on high interest rates, following the practices of microfinance institutions or even infor-\nmal lending [27]. The second one is based on a high volume of small loans (high turnover strat-\negy), which, in this context, implies applying technologies in an efficient way [27]. P2P lending\ntries to keep reasonable interest rates, following a high turnover strategy, by applying successful\nbusiness models of some Internet companies that also operate in the long tail [28].\nP2P lending is a risky activity for individual lenders, because the loans are granted by them,\ninstead of P2P companies, which transfer the credit risk. Credit risk can be defined as the\npotential financial impact of any real or perceived change in borrowers’ creditworthiness, while\ncreditworthiness is the borrowers’ willingness and ability to repay [29]. A credit score is a num-\nber that represents an assessment of the creditworthiness of a person, or the likelihood that the\nperson will repay his or her debts [30]. P2P loans lack collateral or any kind of guarantee fund.\nSo far, those interested in knowing the factors explaining loan default were risk analysts in\nfinancial institutions, specialized in avoiding, transferring or reducing risk.

Zeng [31] reviews and\ncompares some of the legal aspects of P2P in different countries.\nTransactions costs and credit rationing could explain P2P lending growth, but these entities\nface a fundamental problem: information asymmetry. Asymmetric information arises because\nborrowers are better informed than lenders of their ability and willingness to repay. In conse-\nquence, lenders are at a disadvantage. This is one of the main concerns in credit markets [20].\nLeland and Pyle [32] Campbell and Kracaw [33] and Myers and Majluf [34] suggest that infor-\nmational asymmetries may be a primary reason to explain financial institutions’ existence. It is\nnot easy for an individual lender to distinguish borrowers with a high probability of default\nfrom solvent ones. In consequence, a risk expert is needed and this would justify the existence\nof banks. The bank, at least, has historical information on its clients, or even knows them per-\nsonally; whereas an individual P2P lender, screening on his computer, hardly gets a profile\nwith some borrower’s data. Information asymmetry leads to adverse selection, where lenders\ncannot discriminate between borrowers with different credit risks [35]. Adverse selection may\nbe mitigated with quality information. If P2P lending companies just put lenders and borrow-\ners into contact with each other, the information asymmetry problem would imply that few\nlenders would join the P2P credit market, and these companies would have disappeared by the\nlack of lenders. But P2P lending sites offer information on loan quality. While disintermedia-\ntion is a primary characteristic of online P2P lending, these companies are in partnership with\ncredit rating agencies to reduce the information asymmetry problem [1]. Miller [36] empiri-\ncally finds that providing more information improves lender screening and dramatically\nreduces the default rate for high-risk loans, but has little effect on low-risk loans. P2P lending\nsites make an effort towards transparency in their lending process. They do not only provide\ndetailed public information about each available loan, but they also allow downloading of his-\ntorical information with all the loans funded, their characteristics and their status of being sol-\nvent or failed (for example, see Lendingclub.com: https://www.lendingclub.com/info/\ndownload-data.action; Prosper.com: https://www.prosper.com/tools/DataExport.aspx or Kiva.",

This contrasts with common traditional bank practices.\nIn the last years a number of empirical studies have been made using data from P2P lending\nplatforms. Ruiqiong and Junwen [14] perform a recent revision on empirical research. Factors\nexplaining successful funding of loans is a widely researched topic [1], [5], [19], [37], [38], [39].\nLin, Prabhala and Viswanathan [19] study if borrowers’ online friendships increase the proba-\nbility of successful funding and its role in lowering ex post default rates.

Weiss,\nPelger and Horsch [38] study credit bid’s funding success, with similar results. They also study\nthe factors explaining loan final interest rate. They study P2P loan bidding and find that the\nmost important factor lenders use to allocate funds is the rating assigned by the P2P lending\nsite. Traditional banks rely on risk analysts who approve hundreds of operations. By contrast,\nP2P borrowers and lenders are involved in a social network [5].

If P2P lending com-\npanies are accurate, high risk loans will be assigned with low grades and will be charged with\nhigh interest rates. Credit risk stems from the possibility of the borrower defaulting principal\nor interest payments, because of the inability or lack of willingness to pay them back. Being a\nrisky investment, the lenders ask for a premium over the risk-free interest rate. The value of the\ncredit spread over the risk-free interest rate is linked to credit quality, defined as the estimated\ndefault probability and the estimated loss in the event of default [40].\nInterest rates should be more a matter of credit risk than a matter of cost [41]. There are sev-\neral models to explain credit risk [42]. In the structural model by Merton [43] the structure of\nborrower’s liabilities, jointly with the fluctuations in the assets value, determines the probability\nof default and its payoff. Reduced models, such as Jarrow [44], are characterized by two\nassumptions: firstly, an exogenously given process for the loan’s default time; and secondly, an\nexogenously given process for recovery in case of default. Default probabilities are a random\nvariable depending on interest rates and a risk factor. These models are useful for estimating\ndefault probabilities [45]. Therefore:\nH1. The relationship between interest rate and risk of default in P2P is positive.\nThe fulfilment of Hypothesis 1 means that P2P lending companies contribute effectively to\nlower information asymmetries between borrowers and lenders. Hypothesis 2 studies the driv-\ners of default in depth. A number of theoretical models explaining drivers of default for con-\nsumer credit have been developed, for example De Andrade and Thomas [46] and Durkin and\nElliehausen [47]. These models are inspired by corporate bankruptcy models, by replacing the\nvalue of a firm’s assets by borrower characteristics as proxies of individual’s creditworthiness.\nDe Andrade and Thomas [46] propose a credit risk model using option theory and the value of\nthe borrower’s reputation. However, most credit scoring models have an empirical nature [30],\n[48], [49].

Abdou and Pointon [51], in a review of\n214 studies of credit scoring, detail the explicative factors most widely used in empirical studies.\nThomas [52] also surveys credit scoring evaluations by conventional banks, and the variables\nused to evaluate the applicant capacity to reimburse the loan principal and interest payments.\nTwo approaches exist in credit scoring: statistical and judgmental [53]. The statistical\napproach, by using data on past loans, provides the probability of default [54]. The judgmental\napproach is based on expertise of credit analysts [52]. This approach is useful when there is a\nlack of enough data to develop a statistical credit score. Hence, financial institutions rely on it,\nby using the knowledge of their financial experts [55].

The relationship between risk and loan size has been largely dis-\ncussed [30], [61], [62], [63]. There are arguments saying that risk grows when loan size lowers,\nbut it also grows using the opposite arguments. Empirical studies show ambiguous results, with\nnone of them being significant [61], [62]. Jiménez and Saurina [62], studying more than three\nmillion loans, find a negative relationship between risk and loan size, explained because institu-\ntions study large loans more carefully. But the larger the loan analyzed, the higher the probabil-\nity of default is, for a given size of the borrower. What matters is not only the size of the loan\n[63], but also the repayment capability of the borrower [30] and the loss given default, that is,\nthe share of a loan that is lost when a borrower defaults [63].\nCredit scoring mathematical models usually include borrower characteristics, widely\napplied by bankers to reach a subjective judgment, what Altman, Resti and Sironi [50] call the\n4 ‘Cs’ of credit: borrower character (reputation), capital (leverage), capacity (volatility of earn-\nings) and collateral. The variables used in empirical studies include the length of time that\nworkers have been with their current employer, current housing situation, borrower’s income\nand indebtedness ratios [64], [65]. Indebtedness relates debt or loan payments to income; and\nits relationship with solvency has been found relevant in both studies on corporate finance\n[43], [66] and consumer finance [46]. Given the empirical nature of these studies, some vari-\nables can exhibit a high discriminatory power in some studies, whereas in others they do not.\nAn example is the study by Bravo, Maldonado and Weber [67], on Chilean micro-entrepre-\nneurs’ loans, where income is not a relevant variable to predict default.\nCredit history is another key issue in consumer credit scoring [52]. Even for small busi-\nnesses, the owner’s credit history predicts defaults better than financial variables from annual\nstatements do [68]. Asch [69] describes the method followed to obtain FICO ratings, those\nmost widely used by the consumer credit industry, such as credit cards or even some P2P lend-\ning sites.",

However, variables such as loan amount\nor the length of employment do not seem to be relevant within the data analyzed.\nThe main techniques to develop the probability of default are classification models and sur-\nvival analysis, which facilitate estimating not only whether but also when a customer defaults\n[65]. The logistic regression is a well-established technique employed in evaluating the proba-\nbility of occurrence of a default [70] but recent research in credit scoring emphasizes the\nimportance of not only distinguishing ‘good’ and ‘bad’ borrowers, but also predicting when a\ncustomer will default [56], [71], [72]. We have performed a survival analysis and a logistic\nregression analysis. Both techniques use the same data and the same explanatory variables, but\nthe dependent variable differs. In logistic regression, the dependent variable is binary or dichot-\nomous (e.g., default or non-default). By contrast, in the survival analysis the dependent variable\nis the time until the occurrence of an event of interest; in other words, the dependent variable is\nhow long the loan has survived. This is done by means of Cox regression, which relates survival\ntime and explanatory variables.\nTable 6 shows the survival analysis results, by means of 33 Cox regressions, one for each\nexplanatory variable. The Table provides the regression coefficients, standard errors, risk ratios\nand significance of p-values. The regression coefficient is interpreted as ak-fold increase in\nrisk. Hence, a positive regression coefficient for an explanatory variable means that the risk is\nhigher. Risk ratio can be interpreted as the predicted change in the risk for a unit increase in\nthe explanatory variable. The Table reveals important practical findings for lenders. For\nTable 5.

By contrast, the risk of ‘wedding’ loans is 0.647 times\nlower than ‘no wedding’ loans. The significance test for the coefficient tests the null hypothesis\nthat it equals zero. In both small business loans and wedding loans, statistically significant dif-\nferences have been found (p<0.000). Results are coherent with the explanatory analysis, but\nmore precise.\nSurvival curves can be useful for lenders, because they show the probabilities of default at a\ncertain point of time (Fig 1).

At that\ntime, the analyst had 137 defaulted loans of 2008 first semester available, all of them 36 month\nloans. Defaulted loans were matched with 137 non-defaulted loans. The paired matched sam-\nple technique is commonly used in this kind of studies [70], [76]. So the primary sample con-\ntains 274 loans. The holdout sample contains all the loans funded through Lending Club in\n2011 third trimester, from the 1st of July 2011 to the 30th of September 2011. These are 3,788\nloans of 36 months length. Therefore, the analyst could know their status on the 30th of Sep-\ntember 2014. By analyzing the status of the holdout sample loans, 401 are defaulted and 3,387\nare non-defaulted. Then, the accuracy of each of the 7 models can be calculated, measuring the\npercentage of correctly classified loans.\nTable 7 shows the performance of the 7 logistic regression models. Model 1 uses only the\nsubgrade as an explicative variable; further models add variables up to model 7, a full model\ncontaining all the explicative variables. Logistic regression provides several statistics that indi-\ncate the significance of each variable and some goodness-of-fit measures by means of the Hos-\nmer–Lemeshow test and the Nagelkerke-statistics. The Hosmer–Lemeshow test is a statistical\ntest based on grouping cases into deciles of risk and comparing the observed probability with\nthe expected probability within each decile. The p-value in Table 7 is above 0.05, which implies\nthat the proposed model fits the data well. In ordinary linear regression, the primary measure\nof model fit is R-square, which is an indicator of the percentage of variance in the dependent\nvariable explained by the model.

Besides, this is done by means of an online platform where most of the processes\nare automatized. Operating cost is the most important factor explaining interest margins in\nbanking, and P2P lending platforms–like other online businesses- have the use of technologies\nas strength. This can lead to improving the efficiency, a very important factor in a market\nwhere money is bought and sold. Money is a non-differentiated product and its price, the inter-\nest rate, is what matters most. P2P lending can alleviate credit rationing, especially for those\nborrowers placed in the long tail of credit. These advantages could explain P2P lending growth,\nbut it is not problem-free. In the banking business model, the credit risk is assumed by the\nfinancial institution, which has risk management departments with skilled financial analysts,\nsupposedly more expert than individual lenders. In fact, in some countries and US states, the\namount of money an individual lender can invest per platform is limited by law, or even for-\nbidden. In the P2P lending business model, the credit risk is assumed by individuals, who put\nat risk their money lending to other individuals. The information asymmetry problem is huge.\nFor this reason, it is important for the P2P lending site to offer quality information about the\nloan. This information can be provided by third parties, such as external credit scores, or it can\nbe extracted from the platform itself, such as the grade assigned to each loan.\nThe paper analyzes whether the information provided by the P2P lending site, a grade that\nqualifies the loan, complemented with loan and borrower characteristics, explains loan defaults\nand reduces information asymmetry. Firstly, a hypotheses test and a survival analysis have\nbeen performed on the factors explaining loan defaults. Secondly, a regression logistic model\nhas been proposed to predict loan default. The empirical study uses data from Lending Club,\nthe biggest US P2P lending site. To assure intertemporal validation, data contains a primary\nsample with 274 loans funded in 2008 first semester and a test sample with all the 3,788 loans\nfunded by Lending Club in 2011 third trimester.",

These are 36 month loans, so its final status\n(401 defaulted and 3,387 non-defaulted) was known the 30th September 2014.\nThe study results show that there is a clear relationship between the grade assigned by Lend-\ning Club and the probability of default. 94.4% of A-grade loans were reimbursed. This percent-\nage gradually decreases to 61.8% for G-grade loans. The interest rate assigned depends on the\ngrade assigned and the higher the interest rate, the higher the default probability is. Loan pur-\npose is also a factor explaining default: wedding is the less risky loan purpose and small busi-\nness is the riskiest. Borrower characteristics, such as annual income, current housing situation,\ncredit history, and borrower indebtedness are relevant variables. No statistically significant dif-\nferences are found in loan amount or length of employment. The regression model shows that\nthe grade assigned by Lending Club is the variable with the highest predictive capability. Total\npercentages of correctly predicted loans range from 58% to 64.4% in the primary sample, and\nfrom 62% to 80.6% in the holdout sample.
