      "text": "Di Maggio and Yao (2021), using a consumer credit panel dataset, document that FinTech\nborrowers are more likely to default and exhibit higher indebtedness than borrowers from\ntraditional financial institutions. Lots of studies in the FinTech literature focus on the\ndeterminants of P2P loan default by examining the performance of these loans. Most of these\nstudies explore loan and borrower characteristics to evaluate credit risk of P2P loans and\npredict the likelihood of default (see, e.g. Carmichael, 2014; M€ollenkamp, 2017). Serrano-Cinca\net al. (2015), using a sample of 24,449 loans, issued through LendingClub from 2008 until 2014\nfind that factors that best explain default are loan purpose, annual income, current housing\nsituation and indebtedness. They conclude that credit grade has the highest predictive\nprobability, but their model can be improved by including other factors. Similarly, Jagtiani\nand Lemieux (2019) find that the assigned rating grades perform well in predicting loan\nperformance over the two years after origination. Emekter et al. (2015) indicates that credit\nscore, debt-to-income (DTI) ratio and FICO score play an important role in loan defaults.\nDurovi\u0002c (2017) analyzes two loan characteristics, loan term length and loan purpose and finds\nthat longer term loans are more risky than the shorter term ones and the least risky loans are\nthose used for credit card payoff.\nPolena and Regner (2018) define four loan risk classes (based on the assigned credit grade)\nand find that the borrower’s and loan’s information that identified as determinants for default\nin previous studies are only significant in specific loan classes. Chen et al. (2022) use\ntransaction data from LendingClub originated from 2015 until 2018 to estimate the gross rate\nof return (ROR) on an individual loan base and their results reveal that borrowers’ credit\nrating, loan interest rate, loan status and paid-month are the most critical factors to influence\ninvestors’ ROR.\nLots of studies in banking literature show that economic conditions play a crucial role in\nconsumer delinquency and thus should be taken into consideration when assessing loan\nperformance. Louzis et al. (2012) investigating the determinants of non-performing loans in\nGreek banking system show that GDP, unemployment, interest rate and public debt have a\nstrong effect on the level of NPLs in all loan categories."

Credit grade is an important factor determining\nloan performance and default likelihood. As expected, the lower the credit grate the riskier the\nloan. The results show a descending order from A (low risk borrowers) to G (high risk\nborrowers). The estimated exponentiated coefficients for each credit grade are significant at\nthe 1% level. The variable with the highest predictive capability of all in the study is one\nreporting whether a borrower was assigned with grade A. Going up from grade B to grade A\nis associated with a decrease of almost 80% in the odds of becoming a defaulted loan.\nAnother important factor determining the loan outcome is the self-recorded loan purpose.\nThe default probability is high in loans used for small business funding, medical and moving\npurposes, while loans for wedding expenditures, car purchase and credit card bear lower\ndefault risk, with the odds ratio being 0.9213, 0.8541 and 0.9694 respectively.\nVariables\nNumber of\nobservations\nMean\nStd.

This finding is similar to results in Polena and Regner (2018) study.\nThe annual income positively and significantly affects the probability of a loan success.\nBorrowers with high annual income are less likely to default. The odds ratio is 0.8061,\nsuggesting that for one unit increase in the annual income we expect to see a decrease of about\n20% in the odds of defaults.\nDebt-to-income (dti) ratio and number of 30þ days past-due incidences of delinquency in\nthe last two years are positive determinants of the likelihood of borrowers’ default. These\nresults are consistent with Croux et al. (2020), who also find that borrowers with higher dti or\nwith a higher number of credit inquiries are more likely to default.\nOne more open credit line in the borrower’s credit file reduces the loan default probability,\nwith odds ratio being 0.99 (1% percent reduction in the odds ratio).

The higher the number of charge offs within 12 months, the\nhigher the likelihood of a P2P loan default.\nThe housing situation is a significant predictor for borrowers’ default. The indicator of\nwhether a borrower is a homeowner shows high economic significance and decreases the odds\nof delinquent behavior. On the contrary, borrowers who rent their home have a higher risk of\ndefault. This result agrees with Croux et al. (2020) and Polena and Regner (2018) findings.\nStudy’s results also show that short-term loans (36 months) are associated with a lower\nlikelihood of default. This finding is in congruence with the study of Durovi\u0002c (2017) who also\nfound positive relation between loan maturity and default risk. In contrast, as the\nemployment length of the borrower increases the odds of loan success.\nThe macroeconomic variables, that this research mainly focuses on, are statistically\nimportant and strongly impact the likelihood of loan being default.\nThe most important macroeconomic determinant for increasing the odds of loan default is\nunemployment rate. A positive increase of about 18% in the odds of becoming a loan\ndefaulted is expected when the proportion of the population in unemployment increases one\npercent. The finding of a strong negative impact of unemployment rate on P2P loan quality is\nconsistent with the existing financial literature (e.g. Carmichael, 2014; Fallanca et al., 2020).\nThe coefficient of GDP growth rate is statistically significant but, surprisingly, it indicates\npositive relationship with loan defaults, implying that an improvement in the growth of GDP\nresults in a higher likelihood of delinquency. Our findings contradicts, apparently, several\nempirical results, such as those in the study of Croux et al. (2020), who indicates a negative\nrelationship between GDP growth rate and delinquency of P2P loans. Louzis et al. (2012), also,\nshow that consumer and mortgage NPLs are negatively related to the GDP growth rate. The\nfinding of our study in the light of the above could be attributed to the explanation that the\nhigh economy growth may be increase the demand for P2P loans and an increasing debt in\nthe economy may lead to high default rates in the long run."

[12] and Berger and Gleisner [6] review the history of P2P. It can\nbe questioned whether it will become a disruptive innovation, as defined by [13], but it is clear\nthat P2P lending is quickly spreading globally [14]. LendingClub issued $3.5 billion in loans in\n2014, an important figure that nearly doubles the $1.9 billion of the previous year. But it is still\nfar away from the data of any traditional bank, and it represents a small percentage compared\nto the $3.3 trillion in US consumer debt outstanding reported by the US Federal Reserve Sys-\ntem in 2014 (see http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/).\nFinancial intermediation theory justifies P2P growth [7], [8], [9]. Financial intermediation\nis firstly explained by transactions costs [15]. Both conventional financial institutions and P2P\nDeterminants of Default in P2P Lending\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0139427\nOctober 1, 2015\n2 / 22\n\nlending bear customer evaluation costs before the loan is approved. Once the loan is approved,\nthey also carry costs involved in monitoring loan payment as well as loan recovery costs [16].\nHowever, P2P lending can lower other intermediation costs. Since it does not collect deposits,\nP2P lending is not subject to bank capital requirements, neither does it bear the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) fee, and it is not overseen by bank regulators so far."

This contrasts with common traditional bank practices.\nIn the last years a number of empirical studies have been made using data from P2P lending\nplatforms. Ruiqiong and Junwen [14] perform a recent revision on empirical research. Factors\nexplaining successful funding of loans is a widely researched topic [1], [5], [19], [37], [38], [39].\nLin, Prabhala and Viswanathan [19] study if borrowers’ online friendships increase the proba-\nbility of successful funding and its role in lowering ex post default rates. But they do not analyze\nthe predictive capability or the accuracy of the model. Emekter, Tu, Jirasakuldech and Lu [26]\nevaluate the credit risk of P2P online loans, using Lending Club data, but they do not provide\nthe model’s accuracy. Gonzalez and Loureiro [37] study the impact of borrower profiles, focus-\ning on borrowers’ photographs and their results support the ‘beauty premium’ effect. Weiss,\nPelger and Horsch [38] study credit bid’s funding success, with similar results. They also study\nthe factors explaining loan final interest rate. They study P2P loan bidding and find that the\nmost important factor lenders use to allocate funds is the rating assigned by the P2P lending\nsite. Traditional banks rely on risk analysts who approve hundreds of operations. By contrast,\nP2P borrowers and lenders are involved in a social network [5]. Lenders themselves analyze\nand select borrowers. Lee and Lee [1] and Zhang and Liu [39] analyze lenders behavior in P2P\nlending, finding strong evidence of herding behavior among lenders.\nHypothesis Development\nIt has been shown previously that it is important to study the relevance of the information pro-\nvided by the P2P lending site for lowering information asymmetry, identifying the factors\nDeterminants of Default in P2P Lending\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0139427\nOctober 1, 2015\n4 / 22\n\nexplaining P2P defaults. P2P lending platforms assign a grade to each loan, relying on third\nparty information, like FICO score, used by the vast majority of banks and credit grantors.\nThis grade is associated with an interest rate, depending on its credit risk."

      "text": "Moro, Cortez and Rita [49] analyze recent literature in business intelligence applica-\ntions for the banking industry, finding that credit scoring is the main application trend. Alt-\nman, Resti and Sironi [50] affirm that credit-scoring prediction models are often only\ntenuously linked to an underlying theoretical model. Abdou and Pointon [51], in a review of\n214 studies of credit scoring, detail the explicative factors most widely used in empirical studies.\nThomas [52] also surveys credit scoring evaluations by conventional banks, and the variables\nused to evaluate the applicant capacity to reimburse the loan principal and interest payments.\nTwo approaches exist in credit scoring: statistical and judgmental [53]. The statistical\napproach, by using data on past loans, provides the probability of default [54]. The judgmental\napproach is based on expertise of credit analysts [52]. This approach is useful when there is a\nlack of enough data to develop a statistical credit score. Hence, financial institutions rely on it,\nby using the knowledge of their financial experts [55]. However, some of the judgmental\napproaches used for particular lenders in P2P loan allocation lack rigor, being based on aspects\nsuch as beauty or attractiveness of borrowers [37].\nLoan purpose is considered as one of the factors explaining the probability of default [56]. A\nloan to finance a car has not the same risk than a loan for starting a business. Cader and\nLeatherman [57] found that more than 40% of the firms did not survive after 3 years, using a\nsample of 90,134 observations. Knaup and Piazza [58] found that about 40% of the firms sur-\nvived after 5 years, using data from the US Census and Employment. Phillips and Kirchhoff\n[59] found that three out of five new businesses close in the first five years. By contrast, the per-\ncentage of defaulted car loans is 3.59% according to Agarwal, Ambrose and Chomsisengphet\n[60], using a sample of 6,996 loans in different countries. This percentage is 0.88% in May 2015\nin the USA, according to S&P/Experian Auto Default Indices.\nDeterminants of Default in P2P Lending\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0139427\nOctober 1, 2015\n5 / 22\n\nAnother factor is loan size."

The relationship between risk and loan size has been largely dis-\ncussed [30], [61], [62], [63]. There are arguments saying that risk grows when loan size lowers,\nbut it also grows using the opposite arguments. Empirical studies show ambiguous results, with\nnone of them being significant [61], [62]. Jiménez and Saurina [62], studying more than three\nmillion loans, find a negative relationship between risk and loan size, explained because institu-\ntions study large loans more carefully. But the larger the loan analyzed, the higher the probabil-\nity of default is, for a given size of the borrower. What matters is not only the size of the loan\n[63], but also the repayment capability of the borrower [30] and the loss given default, that is,\nthe share of a loan that is lost when a borrower defaults [63].\nCredit scoring mathematical models usually include borrower characteristics, widely\napplied by bankers to reach a subjective judgment, what Altman, Resti and Sironi [50] call the\n4 ‘Cs’ of credit: borrower character (reputation), capital (leverage), capacity (volatility of earn-\nings) and collateral. The variables used in empirical studies include the length of time that\nworkers have been with their current employer, current housing situation, borrower’s income\nand indebtedness ratios [64], [65]. Indebtedness relates debt or loan payments to income; and\nits relationship with solvency has been found relevant in both studies on corporate finance\n[43], [66] and consumer finance [46]. Given the empirical nature of these studies, some vari-\nables can exhibit a high discriminatory power in some studies, whereas in others they do not.\nAn example is the study by Bravo, Maldonado and Weber [67], on Chilean micro-entrepre-\nneurs’ loans, where income is not a relevant variable to predict default.\nCredit history is another key issue in consumer credit scoring [52]. Even for small busi-\nnesses, the owner’s credit history predicts defaults better than financial variables from annual\nstatements do [68]. Asch [69] describes the method followed to obtain FICO ratings, those\nmost widely used by the consumer credit industry, such as credit cards or even some P2P lend-\ning sites."

The FICO score is not built on variables such as annual income, debt-to-income ratio or\njob stability; its algorithm is also kept secret [30].\nTable 4 shows a cross tabulation for discrete variables from the exploratory analysis. A\nhypotheses test has been included, by means of a Chi-square test. The Chi-square test is used\nto discover if there is a statistically significant association between two categorical variables. Of\nthe 24,449 loans analyzed, 2,666 are defaulted (10.9%) and 21,783 non-defaulted (89.1%).\nThere is a clear relationship between the grade assigned by Lending Club and the loan status as\nfollows. 94.4% of A-grade loans are fully paid. This percentage gradually lowers down to 61.8%\nfor G-grade loans. Differences are statistically significant (p<0.001). The grade assigned by\nLending Club matters and helps to reduce the asymmetric information problem between bor-\nrowers and lenders. Loan purpose is a factor that also explains default. For lenders, the less\nrisky loan purpose is wedding loans, with a 92.8% repayment rate. And the most risky is small\nbusinesses funding, with a 78.1% repayment rate (p<0.001). This tells us that there is a statisti-\ncally significant association between small business and default. In fact, the differences were\nstatistically significant in 10 out of 14 loan purposes analyzed. As for the current housing situa-\ntion, mortgage or own are the less risky, facing rent or other. The differences are statistically\nsignificant.\nTable 5 shows the exploratory study on the continuous variables.

However, variables such as loan amount\nor the length of employment do not seem to be relevant within the data analyzed.\nThe main techniques to develop the probability of default are classification models and sur-\nvival analysis, which facilitate estimating not only whether but also when a customer defaults\n[65]. The logistic regression is a well-established technique employed in evaluating the proba-\nbility of occurrence of a default [70] but recent research in credit scoring emphasizes the\nimportance of not only distinguishing ‘good’ and ‘bad’ borrowers, but also predicting when a\ncustomer will default [56], [71], [72]. We have performed a survival analysis and a logistic\nregression analysis. Both techniques use the same data and the same explanatory variables, but\nthe dependent variable differs. In logistic regression, the dependent variable is binary or dichot-\nomous (e.g., default or non-default). By contrast, in the survival analysis the dependent variable\nis the time until the occurrence of an event of interest; in other words, the dependent variable is\nhow long the loan has survived. This is done by means of Cox regression, which relates survival\ntime and explanatory variables.\nTable 6 shows the survival analysis results, by means of 33 Cox regressions, one for each\nexplanatory variable. The Table provides the regression coefficients, standard errors, risk ratios\nand significance of p-values. The regression coefficient is interpreted as ak-fold increase in\nrisk.

The chart at the bottom displays the survival curves for each loan\npurpose. The chart at the top left displays the survival curves for ‘wedding’ loans. It can be\nclearly appreciated that the probability of survival is higher for ‘wedding’ purposes than for\n‘non-wedding’ purposes.

We deﬁne\nfour loan risk classes and test the signiﬁcance of the default determining variables within each loan\nrisk class. Our ﬁndings suggest that the signiﬁcance of most variables depends on the loan risk class.\nOnly a few variables are consistently signiﬁcant across all risk classes.

Introduction\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms are new ﬁnancial intermediaries connecting borrowers and\nlenders. Due to technological innovations they facilitate loans with low intermediation costs and thus\npose a threat for traditional banks [1]. Unsurprisingly, the popularity of P2P lending is rising rapidly.\nFor example, Lending Club, the biggest P2P lending platform in the world, almost doubled the amount\nof issued loans from USD 4.4 billion in 2014 to USD 8.4 billion in 2015. The remarkable growth of P2P\nlending is present in Europe [2] as well as in China [3].\nThe fundamental problem of lending is information asymmetry between borrowers and lenders:\nborrowers have more information about their creditworthiness than lenders have. P2P lending\nplatforms try to decrease this information asymmetry. They apply credit scoring techniques and assign\na risk grade to each loan that may serve as a signal for lenders. Indeed, existing research [4–6] ﬁnds\na positive correlation between a loan’s default and the assigned risk grade. They also ﬁnd further\ndeterminants of the default rate, for instance, the debt-to-income ratio or revolving credit utilization.\nWe conjecture that the signiﬁcance of these default determinants depends on the loan’s risk grade.\nThus, the goal of our study is to evaluate known determinants of borrowers’ default for each risk grade\nseparately. We test this with a new data set consisting of 70,673 loan observations from Lending Club."

The signiﬁcance of other variables depends on the loan risk class.\nFor example, Revolving Credit Utilization which is signiﬁcant in our full data set and in less risky loan\nclasses is not signiﬁcant in loan classes with riskier loans.\nGames 2018, 9, 82; doi:10.3390/g9040082\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/games\n\nGames 2018, 9, 82\n2 of 17\nWe conclude that whether loan/borrower characteristics can be used to predict a loan’s default\nchances actually depends on the loan’s risk class.

Generally, our results contribute to a better\nunderstanding of the mechanisms of P2P lending.

According to [2], there was an average yearly growth of 113%\nin P2P consumer lending between 2012 and 2014 in Europe (excluding the UK).

[3] add that P2P lending has been rapidly growing in China since its launch in 2007.\nAccording to [10], there were 1575 P2P lending platforms in 2014 with an estimated volume of funded\nloans between USD 20 and 40 billion by the end of 2015. These numbers would make China the second\nlargest P2P lending market in the world.\n2.1. Funding Success of P2P Loans\nA number of studies explore what factors contribute to the funding success of P2P loans. Most are\nbased on data from the platform Prosper which used to be the biggest P2P lending platform in the USA.\nProsper had many social features, such as a discussion forum and detailed borrowers’ characteristics\nincluding their photos. Studies, among others, by [11,12], stress the importance of social relationships\nfor funding success. They ﬁnd that borrowers with better social ties are more likely to get their loans\nfunded and to receive a lower interest rate. However, social features were completely removed by\nProsper in 2008.2 Ref. [13] analyze data from the German platform Smava. Their results indicate that\nmen and women are equally likely to get funded.\nSeveral studies focus on herding behavior in P2P lending. Ref. [14] conclude that a 1% increment\nin the number of bids represents a 15% increase of the probability of an additional bid (until the loan is\nfully funded). They also control for borrower/loan characteristics and ﬁnd that the debt-to-income\nratio is negatively correlated with funding, while the credit grade is positively correlated with funding.\nThey ﬁnd no relationship between funding and home ownership or the requested loan amount.\nRef. [15] ﬁnd that lenders observe their peers’ lending decisions and use this information to infer\ncreditworthiness of borrowers. Among their control variables, the debt-to-income ratio is negatively\ncorrelated with funding, while the credit grade, home owner status and the amount requested are\npositively correlated with funding.\n2.2.

Determinants of Borrowers’ Default\nInvesting at P2P lending platforms is a risky activity, because the offered loans are not secured.\nTo decrease the information asymmetry between lender and borrower, borrowers are obliged to provide\nsome personal information, such as annual income or the loan’s purpose. For example, borrowers at\nLending Club are required to provide detailed information about themselves and their credit history.\n1\nTwo reasons for the rapid emergence of P2P lending platforms are put forward in the literature: low intermediation\ncosts [7,8] and credit rationing after the ﬁnancial crisis in 2007/2008 [9].\n2\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ordered P2P lending companies to register their loans as securities and\nprovide them through a bank.\n\nGames 2018, 9, 82\n3 of 17\nP2P lending platforms use this information to assess the likelihood of borrowers’ default and assign\nhim or her an appropriate interest rate with a given grade class.3 It is generally assumed that the better\nthe grade the more likely is the borrower to repay his or her debt.\nThere are several studies, such as [12,17], examining borrowers’ characteristics and their inﬂuence\non borrowers’ default based on data from Prosper. We do not review these studies in detail because\nof the differences between the platforms Prosper and Lending Club.4 Instead, we focus on studies\nexamining borrowers’ default determinants based on Lending Club data: [4–6].\nAll three are in consensus that the Credit Grade5 assigned by Lending Club is the best predictor\nfor borrowers’ default. Moreover, Revolving Credit Line Utilization is another variable inﬂuencing the\ndefault rate mentioned in all three papers. Findings of other default determinants vary. The discrepancy\nbetween the ﬁndings of [4–6] might be caused by three different factors. The ﬁrst factor is the selection\nof variables potentially having an impact on borrowers’ default. For example, Ref. [4,5] found out\nthat the FICO score has an inﬂuence on default. [6] did not choose the FICO score as an independent\nvariable in their study. The second factor potentially creating discrepancy between the ﬁndings is the\ndata set used."

The Lending Club Process\nThe Lending Club connects people who want to borrow money with people who are willing to\nlend their money. Before applying for a loan at the Lending Club, a prospective borrower should ﬁnd\nout the value of his/her FICO score which is widely used by banks and credit providers in the USA.6\nThe FICO score represents the creditworthiness of a person. It is computed based on a borrower’s\npersonal credit report provided by national credit bureaus in the USA. The exact formula for the\nFICO score computation is held secret, only approximate weights of given categories are made public.7\nAbout 90% of borrowers’ applications at Lending Club is rejected because of an insufﬁcient FICO\nscore. Only potential borrowers with a FICO score of at least 600 are allowed to apply for a loan at\nLending Club.\nThe potential borrower is further asked to provide some personal and loan information.\nThe self-reported information is his/her Annual Income, the current Home Situation (potential options\nare own, mortgage or rent), the Length of Employment, the Loan Purpose and a Loan Description. All of\nthis information, except Loan Description, are mandatory.\nAfter checking a borrower’s FICO score and his/her self-reported information, Lending Club\nassigns a risk Loan Grade, from A to G, followed by a more accurate risk Loan Subgrade, from A1 to G5,\nand a corresponding interest rate."

The loans in our data set, however, have six different statuses: Fully Paid, Charged Off, Current,\n6\nAccording to myf [19], up to 90% of top lenders use the FICO score.\n7\nThe FICO score consists of ﬁve categories from a person’s ﬁnancial history: the payment history (about 35% weight),\ndebt burden (30% weight), length of credit history (15%), types of credit used and recent searches for credit (both 10%).\n\nGames 2018, 9, 82\n5 of 17\nDefault, Late (31–120 days), Late (16–30 days) and In Grace Period.

Borrower’s self-reported information are Annual Income,\nHousing Situation, Length of Employment, Loan Amount, Loan Purpose, and Loan Description. The second\nsource of information origin is the borrower’s credit ﬁle provided by one of three national credit\nbureaus in the USA. We choose the following variables from a borrower’s credit ﬁle: Debt−to−Income,\nDelinquency in Past 2 Years, Date of First Credit Line, Inquiries in Past 6 Months, Months since Last\nDelinquency, Months since Last Record, Open Credit Lines, and Revolving Credit Utilization. The description\nof our variables is included in Table A1 in Appendix A.\nWe modiﬁed two variables from the original data set. The ﬁrst variable is Loan Description. It is\nprovided by a borrower when applying for a loan. There are many ways to use Loan Description as an\nindependent variable that might be the predictor for borrowers’ default. For example, Ref. [5] extracted\ntwo dummy variables from Loan Description: Borrower’s Self-Claimed Creditworthiness and Description\nLacking Full Stop. He found that both variables are signiﬁcant for default prediction. Our approach is\ndifferent from [5]. We count the number of characters in Loan Description and call this new variable\nNumber of Characters. The second variable of interest from the original data set that was modiﬁed is\nDate of First Credit Line. It is a variable in the form of ‘month-year’ and represents the reported date of\nthe ﬁrst open credit line. We transformed this variable into the number of years since the ﬁrst reported\ncredit line was opened. The name of this new variable is Length of Credit History.\nThus, our variables are fairly similar to variables used by [4–6]. Unlike these papers though,\nwe do not include information about the Loan Subgrade and the FICO Score. Furthermore, we neither\ninclude the Loan Grade nor the Interest Rate. All these variables are highly correlated, because Loan\nSubgrade, which is more speciﬁc than Loan Grade, is largely based on the FICO score. The interest rate is\nthen assigned based on the Loan Subgrade.\n8\nWe have downloaded the data from the download data section at the Lending Club website."

The trend of the default rate is clearly rising with the\nriskiness of a given loan class—starting with a default rate of 6.59% in the Low-Risk Class and ending\nwith 20.06% in the Very High-Risk Class. The two most frequent loan purposes are Debt Consolidation\n(51.94% of all loans) and Credit Card (18.28%). Furthermore, the purposes Car and Major Purchase have\nthe smallest default rates across all classes. On the other hand, loans with purpose Small Business or\nRenewable Energy have the highest default rate in the All Classes category.9 It is interesting to observe\nhow default rates of given Loan Purposes change in particular loan classes. For example, loans with the\npurpose Moving have a higher default rate in the Medium-Risk Class (17.97%) than in the High-Risk Class\n(14.74%). Similar examples are loans with Home Improvement, Vacation or Car purpose. Table A6 in\nAppendix B contains the Home Situation default statistics. As expected and similarly to the Loan Purpose\nthe default rate is rising with the riskiness of a given loan class. The most frequent Home Situations are\nRent (48.80% of all loans) and Mortgage (42.86%). The frequency of the Home Situation Other (0.16% of\nall loans) and No Information (0.05%) are negligible.\n4.

We then drop every variable with\nap-value higher than 0.1 starting with the variable with the highest p-value. Backward stepwise\nelimination is sometimes criticized for producing models which do not ﬁt the data well. Critics of\nthis approach argue that other models might dominate the model achieved by backward stepwise\nelimination in terms of the Akaike information criterion (AIC), a measurement of relative model\nquality for a given data set. As a robustness check, we have run additional regressions which\nemploy an automated selection of the best model with AIC as criterion. All of our speciﬁcations\nreached by backward stepwise elimination are the same as the speciﬁcations chosen by using AIC as\nselection criterion.\nWe ﬁrst run a logistic regression on the full data set (All Classes) because of two reasons. We want\nto compare our All Classes ﬁndings with results of [4–6]. Moreover, this allows us to highlight the\ndifferences between our regression results from given loan classes and the regression ﬁndings based\non the whole data set.\nResults from the All Classes regression are in Table 4.\nThe coefﬁcients of Loan Amount,\nDebt-to-Income, Delinquency in Past 2 Years, Inquiries in Past 6 Months, Revolving Credit Utilization,\nMonths since Last Record are all positive and highly signiﬁcant. The coefﬁcients of Annual Income,\nNumber of Characters and Lenght of Credit History are all negative and highly signiﬁcant. The variable\nOpen Credit Lines is not signiﬁcant.\nThe loan purposes Car, Credit Card, Debt Consolidation,\nHome Improvement, Major Purchase, and Wedding are negatively correlated with loan default,\nwhile Renewable Energy, and Small Business are positively correlated with loan default. Home ownership\n(status Mortgage) is negatively correlated with loan default.\nWe proceed with regressions for the four loan risk classes, see also Table 4. Results for the Low\nRisk and Medium Risk classes only differ slightly from the All Classes results. In both the Lenght of Credit\nHistory and the loan purpose Home Improvement are not signiﬁcant anymore."

Months since Last Record is\nnot signiﬁcant in the Low Risk class, while it is signiﬁcant in the Medium Risk class. Delinquency in Past\n2 Years is not signiﬁcant in the Medium Risk class, while it is highly signiﬁcant in the Low Risk class.\nIn the High Risk and Very High Risk classes, the Number of Characters are not signiﬁcant anymore as\nwell as the loan purposes Car, Debt Consolidation, Home Improvement and Renewable Energy. The Lenght\nof Credit History is not signiﬁcant in the High Risk class but it is signiﬁcant in the Very High Risk class.\nThe loan purpose Major Purchase is not signiﬁcant anymore in the Very High Risk class.\nRevolving Credit Utilization has been found to be a signiﬁcant predictor for borrowers’ default in\nall related studies [4–6] as well as in our All Classes data. However, it is only signiﬁcant in our Low-Risk\nand Medium-Risk Classes. It is not a signiﬁcant determinant in the High-Risk and Very High-Risk Class.\nResult 1. Revolving Credit Utilization is a positive determinant of borrowers’ default only in low loan\nrisk classes.\nThe Debt-to-Income ratio is signiﬁcant in all loan classes. In fact, the Debt-to-Income ratios for\ndefaulted/non-defaulted loans have almost identical values across risk classes.\nResult 2. The Debt-to-Income ratio is a positive determinant of borrowers’ default in all loan risk classes.\nThe current Housing Situation is a signiﬁcant determinant of default in All Classes, as well as in the\nLow-Risk, Medium-Risk and High Risk classes. It is, however, not signiﬁcant in the Very High-Risk Class.\nDefaulting on a loan when having a mortgage on a house would mean the loss of the house. Therefore,\nthere might be a higher motivation for borrowers to avoid default when having the mortgage than\nliving in a rented home. One of the possibilities to avoid default is to take a further loan. Borrowers from\nthe Very High-Risk Class may not have such an opportunity which might explain that there is no effect\nof the Current Housing Situation."

Home ownership is not a signiﬁcant determinant of borrowers’ default in the highest loan risk class.\nOverall, creditworthy borrowers write, on average, 169 characters in their loan descriptions\ncompared to 157 characters in loan descriptions of defaulted loans. This difference is highly signiﬁcant\n(p < 0.001). Moreover, it is interesting to observe that borrowers in the Very High-Risk Class write,\non average, the most characters in their Loan Description compared to borrowers from other classes.\nBorrowers from the Very High-Risk Class might feel that their Loan Description must be comprehensive\nin order to get funding with a risky loan grade. However, the Number of Characters are neither\nsigniﬁcant in the Very High-Risk Class nor in the High-Risk Class, while they are in low risk classes.\nResult 4. In low loan risk classes, creditworthy borrowers write, on average, a longer Loan Description than\nborrowers who defaulted.\nIt seems that a loan used for Credit Card consolidation has a signiﬁcantly higher chance to be paid\nback even in the Very High-Risk Class, while loans used for a Small Business generally bear a higher\nrisk of default independently of the associated risk class. For example, the default rates of loans with\npurpose Small Business are twice as high as default rates of loans with Car or Wedding as the purpose.\nResults 5. The loan purposes Credit Card and Small Business are signiﬁcant determinants of borrowers’ default\nin all loan risk classes.\nThe Length of Credit History is negatively correlated with loan default in our All Classes regression\nresults.\nThis ﬁnding is in line with [5,6]’s results.\nHowever, it is only supported in the Very\nHigh-Risk Class. The Length of Credit History is not a signiﬁcant determinant of default in the Low-Risk,\nMedium-Risk and High-Risk classes. It seems that experience with loans in the Very High-Risk Class is of\nadvantage as people get used to live close to their credit limits. For example, a young man without any\nprevious credit experiences classiﬁed to be in the Very High-Risk Class, also without any ﬁnancial buffer,\ncan easily overdraw his credit. This might cause a default because of insufﬁcient credit experience and\na lack of possibilities of obtaining an additional loan."

The signiﬁcance of other variables varies class\nby class. Revolving Credit Utilization, Number of Characters or the Lenght of Credit History are signiﬁcant\nfor All Classes but not in given loan classes. Only Open Credit Lines is neither signiﬁcant in any class\nnor on the full data set.\nIn terms of economic signiﬁcance, the following changes of the predicted default probability\nresult from a one standard deviation change of our main explanatory variables: Annual Income (0.005),\nDebt-to-Income (0.01), Inquiries in Past 6 Months (0.02) and the loan purposes Credit Card (−0.06) and\nSmall Business (0.08). Given that, on average, 12.5% of all loans default, a one standard deviation\nchange of the Debt-to-Income ratio increases the chances of default by 6%.12 This value increases to 12%\nfor high risk loans.\nAs a robustness check of our loan grade classiﬁcation we merge the two smallest classes, the High\nand Very High-Risk Class, and consider them jointly. All regressors that are signiﬁcant in the High-Risk\nClass are at least as signiﬁcant in the regression speciﬁcation with observations from both risk classes.\nIn addition, the variables Loan Amount and Months since Last Record are positively correlated with\ndefault. The loan purposes Car and Wedding are negatively correlated with default.\nFinally, we address to what extent these insights are taken into account by lenders, when they\ndecide whether to fund a loan or not. For this purpose, we draw on evidence from existing studies\nwho analyze the funding success of P2P loans. According to both [14,15] loans have a higher chance\nto attract funding, the lower the debt-to-income ratio is and the better the credit grade is. Moreover,\nRef. [15] ﬁnd a positive correlation between funding success and the amount requested as well as\nwhether the borrower’s home is owned.

We ﬁnd that the home ownership\nstatus is only a good indicator of a loan getting paid back if the loan is not from the highest risk class.\nOur results provide insights for potential P2P lenders, especially those who seek to strictly\nmaximize their proﬁt. As mentioned in Section 3, investing in the Very High-Risk Class at Lending Club\nhistorically yields the highest net proﬁt (after accounting for defaulted loans). Thus, investors whose\nprimary goal is to achieve a high return on their investment will target the high risk segment and\nwill try to optimize their loan portfolio choices. Our results contribute to a better understanding to\nwhat extent our existing knowledge about loan default determinants applies in this high risk segment.\nIt seems that for high risk loans Revolving Credit Utilization or the Home Situation status are treacherous\npredictors of default.

Conclusions\nP2P lending connects people in need for a loan with people willing to lend their money.\nThe intermediation of credit is handled through more or less automated online platforms with very\nlow transaction costs. The beneﬁts of automation can transform into lower interest rates for borrowers\nand higher interest earnings for lenders in comparison to traditional banks.\nHowever, information asymmetries between borrowers and lenders remain a central issue faced\nby P2P lending platforms. Credit scoring techniques are employed to address this. They assign a credit\ngrade to each loan based on the perceived risk of default. Riskier loans are associated with higher\ninterest rates as higher interest rates serve as compensation for a potential loan default. Besides the\ncredit grade and interest rate, P2P lending platforms usually provide a prospective lender with a large\namount of information about a loan’s and borrower’s characteristics."
