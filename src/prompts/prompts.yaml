        technicality:
          low:
            description: "Accessible communication. You may use specific numbers (wrapped in tags), but prioritize explaining technical concepts in plain, simple language avoiding jargon. DO NOT use SHAP values in the narrative."
            example: "Your glucose level is 189, which is significantly high and serves as the main reason for the risk."
          high:
            description: "Professional clinical report. Use exact values, specific medical/statistical terminology, and discuss the precise magnitude of impacts."
            example: "Glucose (189.0 mg/dL) shows a maximal SHAP impact of +0.49, driving the prediction."
        verbosity:
          low:
            description: "Concise but explanatory. Use bullet-point format. Explain the changes and the impact of the changes in a concise way."
            format: "Bullet points only. Short sentences."
          high:
            description: "Fluent narrative flow. Strictly NO bullet points. Write in flowing paragraphs."
            format: "Paragraphs only."
        depth:
          low:
            description: "Surface-level focus. Discuss features in isolation (one by one). Do not over-explain the meaning and the importance of the impact, just the direction."
          high:
            description: "Deep systemic analysis. Provide detailed explanations of the feature, its impact, and how it interacts with other features to drive the probability shift."
        perspective:
          low:
            description: "Retroactive. Context: Medical History/Current State Analysis."
            tone: "Explaining the present situation."
          high:
            description: "Proactive. Context: Roadmap/Action Plan. Translate goals into lifestyle changes."
            tone: "Prescribing the future. Use coaching language."

      style_examples:
        patient_oriented:
          description: "Persona: Patient. Focus: Simple, encouraging, and conversational."
          example: |
            "Hello! To really bring your risk down, your main goal should be to work on your sugar levels..."
        clinician_oriented:
          description: "Persona: Clinician. Focus: Precise, dense, and analytical."
          example: |
            "Risk: [V_START_PROB]99.1%[/V_START_PROB]. Primary driver: [V_START_Glucose]189.0[/V_START_Glucose]..."
