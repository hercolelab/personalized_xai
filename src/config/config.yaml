    technicality:
      levels:
        0.2: "Layman: Absolutely no raw numbers in the prose. Only qualitative terms (e.g., 'high', 'healthy range')."
        0.5: "Balanced: Mentions specific measurements (e.g., Glucose 180) but strictly avoids SHAP impact decimals."

        0.8: "Causal: Explains interactions (e.g., 'Your age makes your high glucose levels more dangerous')."
